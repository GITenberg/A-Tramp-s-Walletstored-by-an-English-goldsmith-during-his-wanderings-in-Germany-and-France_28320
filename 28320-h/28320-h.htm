<p style="text-align: right">THE AUTHOR.</p>
<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>During a stay of three years and a half in Germany and France,
sometimes at work, sometimes tramping through the country, the
Author collected a number of facts and stray notes, which he has
endeavoured in these pages to present to the public in a readable
shape.</p>
<p>Of the twenty-eight chapters contained in the volume, sixteen
originally appeared in &ldquo;Household Words.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
are entitled <span class="smcap">The German Workman</span>; <span
class="smcap">Hamburg to L&uuml;beck</span>; <span
class="smcap">L&uuml;beck to Berlin</span>; <span
class="smcap">Fair-time at Leipsic</span>; <span
class="smcap">Down in a Silver Mine</span>; <span class="smcap">A
Lift in a Cart</span>; <span class="smcap">The Turks&rsquo;
Cellar</span>; <span class="smcap">A Taste of Austrian
Jails</span>; <span class="smcap">What my Landlord
Believed</span>; <span class="smcap">A Walk through a
Mountain</span>; <span class="smcap">Cause and Effect</span>;
<span class="smcap">The French Workman</span>; <span
class="smcap">Licensed to Juggle</span>; <span
class="smcap">P&egrave;re Panpan</span>; <span class="smcap">Some
German Sundays</span>; and <span class="smcap">More Sundays
Abroad</span>.&nbsp; Several other chapters were published in a
weekly newspaper; and the remainder, together with the
Introductory Narrative, appear in print for the first time.&nbsp;
For the careful and valuable revision of that portion of his book
which has appeared in &ldquo;Household Words,&rdquo; the Author
here begs to express his sincere thanks; and to acknowledge, in
particular, his obligation to some unknown collaborator, who, to
the paper called &ldquo;The French Workman,&rdquo; has added some
valuable information.</p>
<p>The desire of the Author in writing the Introductory Narrative
was to present to his readers a brief outline of his whole
journey, and a summary of its results; and to connect, so far as
it was possible, the somewhat fragmentary contents of the body of
the work.&nbsp; It was also hoped and believed that the
statistical information there given, although of so humble a
character, would be valuable as illustrative of the social
condition of workmen in the countries to which they refer, and of
a character hitherto rarely attempted.</p>
<p>Written, as these chapters were, at intervals of time, and
separately published, each paper must be taken as complete in
itself; and, as they are separate incidents of one narrative,
occasional repetitions occur, which could scarcely have been
erased, now that they are collected together, without injuring
the sense of the passage.&nbsp; For that portion of the book
which has appeared in print no apology will be expected; and,
with regard to the remainder, the Author has rather endeavoured
to avoid censure than hoped to propitiate it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Author must add, in order that he may not
stand self-accused of misleading his readers with regard to his
personal position, that good fortune has so far favoured his own
exertions, that, although still of the craft, he can no longer
lay claim to the title of a Journeyman Goldsmith.&nbsp; It was
while in that capacity that the greater part of the following
pages were written: he cannot but believe that they may be of
some practical utility; and if, added to this, their perusal
should afford to his readers some portion of that pleasure which
their composition yielded to him, his purpose will have been
fully answered.</p>

i</span>INTRODUCTORY NARRATIVE.</h2>
<h3>HAMBURG.&mdash;ON TRAMP TO BERLIN.</h3>
<p>There have appeared from time to time, in public print,
sorrowful recitals of journeys attempted by English workmen in
foreign countries, with no better result than the utter failure
of the resources of the adventurous traveller, and his return
homeward by the aid of private charity or the good offices of his
consul.&nbsp; It is precisely because the travels about to be
here narrated were financially a success, being prosecuted
throughout by means of the wages earned during their progress,
that it is thought they may be worthy of publication; not that it
is imagined many such examples may not be found, but because
success in such an undertaking has not hitherto appeared so often
before the public as failure.&nbsp; This narrative is necessarily
a personal one; and as it is my especial object in this place to
present these foreign rambles in a pecuniary point of view, I
trust I shall not be misunderstood in stating minute items of
receipt and expenditure, as such details, however trivial they
may appear, are of vital importance in estimating the comparative
position of the foreign and the English workman.</p>
<p>There was more than one cause which prompted me to seek my
fortune abroad; but it is sufficient here to state, that I had
worked in the company of Germans, and had thus become interested
in their country, and, as great depression prevailed at the time
among the goldsmiths in London, I provided myself with a letter
of introduction to a working jeweller in Hamburg, and prepared to
start for this outpost of the great German continent.&nbsp; My
whole <!-- page ii--><a name="pageii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ii</span>capital amounted to five pounds
sterling; and, armed with a passport from the Hanseatic consul,
and provided with an extra suit of clothes, a few books, and some
creature comforts, I embarked for my destination on board the
&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; a trading schooner, then lying in Shadwell
basin.</p>
<p>I paid thirty shillings for my passage, including provisions,
and could have slept in the cabin, and fared with the captain,
for two pounds, but in the weak state of my finances, considered
it only prudent to content myself with sailor&rsquo;s beef and
biscuit, and a hard bulk and coil of ropes for my bed.&nbsp;
After, to me, a rough sea and river passage of eight days, marked
by no greater incidents than belonged to the vicissitudes of the
weather, we crossed the sand-bar at the mouth of the Elbe, and
were soon safe at our moorings in the outer harbour of
Hamburg.&nbsp; It was Sunday morning; paddled on shore in the
ship&rsquo;s boat, I found myself in a town utterly strange to
me, armed only with a letter addressed to a person with whom I
could not converse, and written in a language I did not
understand.&nbsp; My chief comforts were three sovereigns,
carefully wrapped in a piece of cotton print, and deposited in my
fob.</p>
<p>In the course of a ramble through the town, I discovered an
English hotel, and was there happy in making the acquaintance of
a needle-maker of Redditch, Worcestershire, who at once offered
to be my interpreter and guide in search of employment.&nbsp; We
began our peregrinations on the morrow, and I was first
introduced to the only English cabinet-maker established in
Hamburg, who, however, did not receive our visit
cheerfully.&nbsp; He drew a rueful picture of trade generally,
but more especially of his own.&nbsp; The hours of labour were
long, he said; the work was hard, and the wages
contemptible.&nbsp; He concluded by assuring me that I had been
very ill advised to come there, and that the best course I could
pursue was to take the first ship home again.&nbsp; As I was not
yet inclined to follow this doleful piece of advice, we continued
our enquiries.&nbsp; In a short time I was shaking hands with the
jeweller to whom my letter of introduction was addressed; and
before another hour had elapsed, acting under his instructions, I
had the gratification of knowing that I was &ldquo;in
work,&rdquo; and, best of all, under an employer who spoke the
English, French, and German languages with equal facility.&nbsp;
Thus, in ten days from leaving England, eight of which were spent
on the passage, I had found both friends and employment in a
foreign city, and now that my greatest source of anxiety <!--
page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>for the future was removed, felt thoroughly independent
and at my ease.</p>
<p>My companions in the workshop were a quiet Dane who spoke
German, and a young Frenchman, whom I will call Alcibiade, who
had been in London, and acquired a smattering of English.&nbsp;
We worked twelve hours a day, commencing at six o&rsquo;clock in
the morning&mdash;the whole city was up and busy at that
hour&mdash;and kept on till seven in the evening.&nbsp; Thirteen
hours were thus spent in the workshop, one of which was given to
meals.&nbsp; The practice of boarding the workmen is universal in
Hamburg, and we therefore fared at the table of our
&ldquo;principal,&rdquo; and were amply and well provided
for.&nbsp; During the first week of my stay in Hamburg, I lodged
at an humble English hotel, where I paid at the rate of ten marks
a week for bed and board, a sum equal to eleven shillings and
eightpence.&nbsp; Reasonable as this may appear, it was beyond my
resources, and would indeed have been a positive extravagance
under the circumstances.&nbsp; Moreover, the arrangements of the
workshop forbade it.&nbsp; My next lodging was at a German hotel,
where I slept in a little cupboard which hung over a black,
sluggish canal, and was without stove or fire-place.&nbsp; The
cost of this chamber was five marks a month, or scarcely one
shilling and sixpence a week.&nbsp; These expenses will appear
paltry and insignificant, till compared with the amount of wages
received, when it will be apparent that boarding and lodging in
an English hotel at eleven shillings and odd pence a week, was a
monstrous extravagance; and that even an apartment in a German
gasthaus, at five marks a month, was more than the slender
pittance received would reasonably bear.&nbsp; Alcibiade, who,
besides being an expert workman, was an excellent modeller and
draughtsman, received seven marks a week, with board and lodging,
or eight shillings weekly in positive cash.&nbsp; Peterkin the
Dane, who was yet a novice, was in the receipt of four marks a
week, and paid for his own lodging&mdash;weekly pay, four
shillings and eightpence.&nbsp; My own wages were seven marks a
week and board, while I paid for my own lodging; and when, upon
the departure of Alcibiade for Berlin, I took possession of his
bedroom&mdash;a mere box without a window&mdash;a deduction of
one mark was made as an equivalent.&nbsp; I thus received in
wages six marks; lodging may be reckoned at one, and board at
five marks a week&mdash;total, twelve marks; which will yield in
English money the magnificent sum of fourteen shillings.</p>
<p><!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>In order to contrast these figures more fully with the
pay of our English artisans, it will be necessary to mention some
further expenses to which the workman in England is not liable,
or in which the commercial pre-eminence of his country gives him
a marked advantage.&nbsp; With respect to the former, as the
employer in many cases furnishes only the ruder and less portable
machinery of the workshop, the workman has, to a certain extent,
to provide his own tools; and in regard to the latter, clothing
in general, and more especially cotton, woollen, and worsted
articles of apparel, are nearly as costly as in London.</p>
<p>Of the social position of the workmen, and the rules of the
trade Guilds, I have endeavoured to treat under the head of
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The German Workman</span>;&rdquo; but
there are some matters there omitted which may be worthy of
mention.&nbsp; I was forcibly struck, as well in Hamburg as in
other towns and cities of Germany, by the almost total want of
that cheap serial literature which is so marked a feature of
popular education in England.&nbsp; There was, indeed, a penny
magazine published in Leipsic, after the type of the original
periodical of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge;
but it found no purchasers among any of my acquaintances, and was
only to be seen, with a few other literary magazines, at the
better sort of eating and coffee-houses.&nbsp; The workmen were
gay, and fond of amusement, but not recklessly so.&nbsp; They
were passionately fond of music, and formed little clubs among
themselves for the practice of choral singing.&nbsp; There was
shown no want of respect for the Church and its institutions,
quite the reverse; and I well remember that we were gratified
with a holiday on a day set apart by the authorities for the
public confirmation of the youths about to be apprenticed, and
the whole ceremonial of which wore an imposing and solemn
character.&nbsp; The conscription was, I believe, made also on
that day.&nbsp; With respect to the relation between employers
and employed, there existed a degree of amiability and
consideration for which we look too often in vain in England,
while it must also be confessed that every mark of respect was
rigorously exacted by the master, and that his affability towards
the workmen sometimes assumed the character of an affectionate
condescension towards a favoured menial.&nbsp; I did not
personally know any one married journeyman in Hamburg; but there
was one jeweller who had entered into the silken bonds of
wedlock, and who was pointed out to me with a shrug of the
shoulder and a shake of the head, as a doomed mortal.</p>
<p><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>It might be imagined that as the city of Hamburg claims
the title of &ldquo;free,&rdquo; such assumed liberty might
extend to its social institutions; as well as to its port and
navigation.&nbsp; Indeed, the worthy citizens are under some such
delusion themselves, and boast of immunities, and liberalities of
government, such as would place them at the head of the German
nation.&nbsp; It would be hard to know in what they
consist.&nbsp; The passport system is enforced with all its
rigours and impertinences; an annual conscription is taken of its
inhabitants, and the more solvent of them perform military
service (this may perhaps be considered a liberty), as a national
guard, with the additional luxury of providing their own weapons
and equipments.&nbsp; Moreover, they were, at the time I write
of, called upon to render certain services in case of an outbreak
of fire: one contributing a bucket, another a rope, and a third a
ladder; none of which articles, as might easily be imagined, were
forthcoming when most wanted.&nbsp; The city tolls were heavy,
and stringently levied, and, what more nearly concerned the
exercise of public liberty and private convenience, the city
gates were nominally closed at a certain hour in the evening,
varied according to the season of the year, and were only to be
passed after the appointed period by the payment of a toll.&nbsp;
It was curious to see the people hurrying towards the Jacob Thor
on a Sunday evening as the hour of closing approached, jostling
and mobbing each other in their endeavours to escape the human
poll tax.</p>
<p>But men are free, or in fetters, only by comparison; and
although the rule of the senate of Hamburg, when contrasted with
British government, can scarcely be called a liberal one, there
is little doubt that identical laws are in Hamburg less
stringently carried out than in other and most parts of the great
German continent.</p>
<p>Seven months&rsquo; stay in Hamburg found me eager to commence
the march into Germany, which I had long meditated.&nbsp; Five
months had already elapsed since Alcibiade, my French
fellow-workman, had departed for Berlin (paying eight dollars for
the journey by post), and he had never written to inform me of
his fortunes.&nbsp; I was resolved to follow him, and, if
possible, to seek him out, for we were already sworn friends; but
my finances would only allow of a journey on foot.&nbsp; During
twenty-eight weeks of employment in Hamburg, I had received two
hundred and three marks banco in wages, which would yield, in
round numbers, twelve pounds sterling, or exactly an average
receipt of five shillings per week.&nbsp; Against this sum were
to be placed: expenses for tools, five shillings and <!-- page
vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>sixpence; trade society and police, five shillings and
tenpence; clothing and washing, three pounds, one shilling and
twopence; and rent and extra board, one pound seven shillings.
Seventeen visits to theatres at prices ranging from two shillings
to sevenpence amounted to sixteen shillings and sixpence, making
a total of five pounds sixteen shillings. The surplus of six
pounds four shillings had been further reduced, by outlay in
necessities or indulgences, as the reader may assume according to
his fancy, to thirty marks banco.&nbsp; With this sum of
thirty-five shillings in English money, and consisting of two
Dutch ducats and five Prussian dollars, I started to tramp the
two hundred miles between Hamburg and Berlin.&nbsp; As a matter
of explanation it may be stated that, during a residence of seven
months in Hamburg, I had acquired enough of the German language
to trust myself alone in the country.</p>
<p>Under the impression that I might be required to set to work
in any town on my route, like any travelling tinker, I had packed
in my knapsack my best scoopers and an upright drillstock; and
these tools, while they added to its weight, presented so many
obdurate points of resistance to my back.&nbsp; Stowed within the
knapsack were an extra suit, two changes of linen, a few books, a
flute, and a pair of boots.&nbsp; It weighed twenty-eight
pounds.&nbsp; My remaining personal property was safely packed in
a trunk, and left in the hands of a friend, to be forwarded by
waggon as soon as my resting place should be determined.</p>
<p>I have only to deal in this place with the statistics of my
first tramp.&nbsp; The distance was lessened sixty miles by
taking the <i>eilwagen</i> from Wusterhausen to Berlin, and nine
days in all were spent upon the road.&nbsp; My total expenses,
including the dollar (three shillings) for coach fare, amounted
to eighteen shillings, or an average of two shillings
a-day.&nbsp; Of this sum I may particularise the cost of the
straw-litter and early cup of coffee at the outset of the
journey, twopence; at L&uuml;beck, where I lodged respectably for
one night, the bill was two shillings; at Sch&ouml;nefeld,
twopence halfpenny; a lodging, and board for two nights and a day
at Schwerin in a &ldquo;grand hotel,&rdquo; but faring with the
servants, cost one shilling and ninepence; at Ludwigslust, a
comfortable bed after a grand supper with the carpenters at their
house of call, was charged one shilling and sevenpence; and at
Perleberg, where I lodged superbly, the cost was sixteen silver
groschens, or a fraction over one shilling and sixpence.</p>
<p>Against this I have to place the trade gift of two shillings
at <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>L&uuml;beck, being the whole contents of their cash
box, and which was kindly forced upon me.&nbsp; At
Sch&ouml;nefeld I was urged by the masons to demand the usual
&ldquo;geschenk&rdquo; from the only jeweller in the
village.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord,
enthusiastically, &ldquo;if you only get a penny, it will buy you
a glass of beer!&rdquo;&nbsp; I overcame the temptation.</p>
<h3>BERLIN AND LEIPSIC.&mdash;ON TRAMP TO VIENNA.</h3>
<p>I was less fortunate in the search for work in Berlin than I
had been in Hamburg.&nbsp; Having started on my travels too early
in the year, I paid the penalty of my rashness.&nbsp; My guide
into Berlin was a glovemaker, whose acquaintance I had made upon
the road, and through whom, curiously enough, I succeeded in
discovering my Parisian friend Alcibiade, the first object of my
search.&nbsp; Alcibiade, eccentric, but frank and generous,
received me like a brother.&nbsp; There was no employment to be
obtained in Berlin, or assuredly he would have ferreted it out;
more especially as in the search he had the assistance of one of
those philological curiosities met with in Germany more often
than in any other country, a school-teacher, who seemed to have
any number of foreign languages glibly at the end of his
tongue.&nbsp; I stayed a week in Berlin, sleeping at the Herberge
in the Schuster Gasse, described in the body of this work; and
when forced at length to depart, Alcibiade pressed four dollars
upon me as a loan, to help me on my further wanderings.&nbsp; It
must be remembered that my stock was reduced to seventeen
shillings on my arrival at Berlin, and as my expenses in this
capital, during a week&rsquo;s vain search for employment,
amounted to nine shillings, I was but indifferently
provided.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I asserted my claim to
the trade geschenk, and, having fulfilled all the conditions of a
tramp unable to find work, received from the Guild twenty silver
groschens, or two shillings.</p>
<p>Leipsic was my natural destination, and thither I proceeded by
railway, paying two dollars eight groschens for the transit in an
open carriage.&nbsp; This would give seven shillings in English
money.&nbsp; The journey occupied about twelve hours, and
although the average speed through the Prussian territory was
slow, no sooner did we come upon Saxon ground at the frontier
town of K&ouml;then, than we spun along over the sandy waste with
a rapidity which reminded one of <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>a trip on
an English railway.&nbsp; It was already dark when the train
reached Leipsic, and in the drizzling rain I wandered round the
city ditch and rampart, unknowing where to find a lodging.&nbsp;
At length, directed by a stranger to a trade herberge in the
Kleine Kirche Hof, after some demur on account of my not
belonging to the proper craft, I was admitted to a sort of
out-house, paved with red bricks, and allowed a bed for the
night.&nbsp; On the morrow I presented a letter of
recommendation, from my good genius Alcibiade, to one of the
principal jewellers in the city, and felt inexpressibly happy on
being at once taken into employment.&nbsp; I spent two delightful
months in Leipsic.&nbsp; My fortnight&rsquo;s ramble, with its
discomforts and anxieties, had given me a desire for rest, and in
the bustling town, (it was the Easter fair time), skirted by its
fringe of garden, and among its pleasant, good-natured
inhabitants, the time sped happily on.</p>
<p>The pay was better than in Hamburg, but the living
worse.&nbsp; My wages were four dollars&mdash;twelve shillings
per week&mdash;and board and lodging.&nbsp; I slept in the same
room with my one fellow workman and an apprentice.&nbsp; It was
light, and scrupulously clean, but had the single disadvantage of
being so low in the ceiling, that one could not stand upright in
it.&nbsp; Saxony has the unenviable distinction of being the
country the worst fed in Germany.&nbsp; I had no prejudice
against Saxon fare upon my arrival in Leipsic, but found, after a
fortnight&rsquo;s trial, that I could not possibly endure its
unvarying boiled fresh beef, excessively insipid, with no other
accompaniment than various kinds of beans stewed into a sort of
porridge.&nbsp; Potato dumplings were a luxury with us.</p>
<p>I am afraid I seriously offended my worthy
&ldquo;principal,&rdquo; on pleading my inability to persist in
this kind of training.&nbsp; But he acquiesced in the desire to
board myself, and generously made the additional payment of one
dollar sixteen groschens, or five shillings per week, for the
purpose.&nbsp; I found no difficulty in tracing out a
&ldquo;restauration,&rdquo; the proprietor of which readily
undertook to furnish one principal meal per diem for seventeen
silver groschens, that is, one shilling and eightpence halfpenny
per week, paid in advance.&nbsp; Each dinner cost, therefore, a
fraction less than threepence.&nbsp; With the remainder of the
allowance it was easy to purchase a simple supper, and even some
small luxuries now and then.&nbsp; The dinners, although
certainly not sumptuous, were wholesome, and infinitely more
relishing than the fresh beef and beans of the <!-- page ix--><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>&ldquo;principal&rsquo;s&rdquo; table; while there was a
relief in quitting the workshop for a while, to descend the steep
wooden staircase leading from the street into the cellar, which
formed the dining-room of the eating-house.</p>
<p>The great Easter fair had just commenced as I reached Leipsic,
and with its termination came my stay in the city also to an
end.&nbsp; The work was exhausted.&nbsp; I had luxuriated in a
few brilliants and the old Polish rose-diamonds, and had
descended to mounting a monstrous meerschaum pipe in
silver.&nbsp; But now there was nothing left but the turquoises
and Bohemian garnets, set in millegriffes, and the Herr shook his
head, and decided that they would not pay; so I received notice
to leave in a fortnight.&nbsp; During this period of six weeks,
my receipts in wages were six-and-twenty Prussian dollars, or
three pounds eighteen shillings, which would allow an average of
eleven shillings per week with board and lodging.&nbsp; Of
expenses incurred there were: for Guild and police, eightpence;
and clothing and washing, fourteen shillings.&nbsp; The
Leipsicers have an ugly trick of doubling the prices of the
theatre during the fair time, so that my expenditure on that head
was <i>nil</i>.&nbsp; My trunk, forwarded from Hamburg in
fourteen days, and weighing seventy pounds, cost three shillings
in the transit, including sixpence for city toll.</p>
<p>After a vain search for further employment in Leipsic, and a
disappointment of obtaining a situation in Altenburg, there
appeared nothing before me but a toilsome march through Dresden
to Vienna, with little hope of finding occupation by the way, and
scarcely more than twenty shillings in my pocket.&nbsp; At this
crisis there came a welcome letter from Alcibiade, with the
tidings that certain employment, for at least two months, awaited
me in Berlin.&nbsp; This was pleasant news indeed; and the Herr
entered so fully into the necessity of seizing this golden
opportunity, that he kindly released me from a day&rsquo;s labor,
that I might have full time to make my preparations.&nbsp; One
would naturally suppose that a few hours would suffice to pack my
little stores and to depart; but there were the Guild regulations
to fulfil, the railway officials to be waited on, and the police
to satisfy.&nbsp; The last-named gentlemen would not consent to
<i>vise</i> my passport till I should produce my railway ticket,
as a proof of my intention to go; while the railway officials
doubted the propriety of issuing a ticket till I had received the
authority of the police for my departure.&nbsp; Here was a case
of daggers&mdash;a dead lock; but the railway was obliged to cede
the ground, and I departed in <!-- page x--><a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>peace.&nbsp; As
I was to start at six in the morning, the Herr rose earlier than
was his wont, prepared for me with his own hands a cup of hot
coffee, kissed me on both cheeks, and wished me God speed.</p>
<p>My stay in Berlin was limited to six weeks.&nbsp; It would
have been longer, but that Alcibiade had set his heart upon
tramping to Vienna at the end of that period; and I was pledged
to accompany him.&nbsp; We worked together at one of the court
jewellers.&nbsp; Alcibiade stood in high favour, and received in
wages thirty dollars per calendar month, or an average rate of
twenty-two shillings and sixpence a week.&nbsp; My own wages were
fixed at twenty-four dollars a month to begin with, or eighteen
shillings a week; but I received ten dollars for the last ten
days of my engagement, which brought me on a level with my
Parisian friend.&nbsp; These were, I believe, high wages.&nbsp;
We worked twelve hours a day.&nbsp; The city of Berlin had
outgrown the feudal usages of Hamburg and Leipsic, and we were no
longer lodged under the same roof with the Herr, nor humbly ate
at his table.&nbsp; Alcibiade had an apartment in a rambling
house with a princely staircase, but the central court of which
happened, unfortunately, to be a stable.&nbsp; An extra bed and
double rent enabled us to domicile together, and we paid for this
chamber, roomy and commodious (always overlooking the stable),
per month, together with morning coffee and a bullet of white
bread, two dollars eighteen groschens each.&nbsp; This would
give, in English money, seven shillings and tenpence, being less
than two shillings a week.&nbsp; Our average expenses for living
were five shillings each per week; and thus, while our whole
weekly necessities were met by the sum of seven shillings, we
were in the receipt of eighteen shillings and twenty-two
shillings and sixpence respectively.&nbsp; Reckoning, however,
the average wages in Berlin at sixteen shillings a week, it will
be seen that the artisan, whose necessary outlay for food and
lodging need certainly not exceed seven shillings, is at least in
as good a position as his self-vaunted brother of London upon
thirty shillings.&nbsp; It naturally results that the mechanics
of Berlin, unlike those of the smaller towns of Germany,
&ldquo;are married and given in marriage,&rdquo; although the
practice is regarded even there as indiscreet and
improvident.&nbsp; It is doubtless a creditable feeling which
demands of the workman that he shall have past out of his state
of servitude, and have gained the position of an employer of
labor, before he dare assume still higher responsibilities; but
the system has also great evils.</p>
<p><!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>During my employment of one calendar month and ten days
in Berlin, I received thirty-four dollars in wages, or five
pounds two shillings.&nbsp; Of expenses, to the trade Guild, were
paid tenpence; for a silk hat, four shillings and twopence; a
visit to Potsdam cost three shillings and tenpence, including
railway fare; and the fee for viewing the King&rsquo;s Palace in
Berlin was tenpence.&nbsp; One shilling and twopence were lost in
<i>agio</i>, in exchanging my small remaining stock of Prussian
dollars into Austrian gold.&nbsp; I may mention, that the binding
of an 18mo. volume in boards, covered in paper, cost one
groschen, eight pfennige, or, as nearly as it can be calculated,
twopence in English money.</p>
<p>As we were upon the point of departure, there arrived in
Berlin an old friend whom we had known in Hamburg, a silversmith
of Vienna, accompanied by two other silversmiths, natives of
L&uuml;beck, all bound to the same goal.&nbsp; We made common
cause at once.&nbsp; We started by rail for Leipsic; Alcibiade
provided with a purse of no less than eighty dollars, or twelve
pounds sterling, his savings in Berlin, while my own stock, with
all my sparing and scraping, scarcely amounted to two pounds.</p>
<p>The length of the railway between Berlin and Leipsic is
between eighty and a hundred miles.&nbsp; From Leipsic, where we
stayed only one night, sleeping at the herberge, and supping off
roasted pigeons, we had, in round numbers, about four hundred
miles before us.</p>
<p>Having narrated the chief incidents of this journey under
other heads, I will only mention isolated points there omitted,
and sum up its general results.&nbsp; Leipsic was our real
starting-point for the tramp, and our first haven the Saxon
capital Dresden.&nbsp; We took the road through Altenburg, thus
diverging considerably from the common route, in order to visit
the silver mines of Freiberg, and ramble through the romantic
scenery of the Plaunischen Grund.&nbsp; We passed through Saxon
Altenburg, Zwickau, Lichtenstein, Chemnitz, Oderan, Freiberg,
Tharant, and Wildsruf, and arrived in the evening of the fifth
day at Dresden.&nbsp; We had in reality no business near Zwickau,
but were seduced out of our direct route by the offer of a cheap
ride in an open waggon, and were thus led to a secluded village,
where our couch of rest was among the beer puddles on the table
of the village tap.&nbsp; On the morrow we found we were a
day&rsquo;s march out of our road.&nbsp; Finding that my stock of
cash was already reduced to the half of its original bulk, that I
had indeed expended one pound, I seriously endeavoured to find
employment in Dresden; but utterly failing in that hope, I
claimed the <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>&ldquo;viaticum&rdquo; of the Guild,
which was ten silver groschens, or one shilling.&nbsp; We lodged
at the herberge during our stay, and were cleanly and comfortably
housed, and at a reasonable cost.&nbsp; It is a fact highly
honourable to the Saxons, that the only trade herberges in
Germany which are in any way decent, are those of Leipsic and
Dresden.&nbsp; We rested in the Saxon capital during three days,
visiting its principal attractions, and then prepared once more
for the road.</p>
<p>There were many official regulations to observe before we
could quit the city.&nbsp; Alcibiade and I, who had passports,
were not called upon to show the condition of our finances, but
our three companions, possessing only wander-books, an inferior
kind of pass which marks the holder as a simple workman wholly
dependent on his labor, were called upon to exhibit a sum equal
to at least ten shillings each.&nbsp; Now, the collective
resources of our three companions were certainly not equal to one
pound ten shillings; but, as may be easily imagined, a little
sleight-of-hand would make any one of them appear to be possessed
of the stock of the whole.&nbsp; And this was done; and thus the
police were daily and hourly deceived.&nbsp; In addition to the
usual official routine&mdash;the testimony of the father of the
herberge to our having paid our score, the authority of the
vorsteher that we were not indebted to the Guild, and the usual
police <i>visa</i>&mdash;we had each to obtain the signature of
his own consul; that of the Saxon minister, as a testimony of his
willingness to allow us to go; and of the Austrian consul, as a
sign that the Imperial Government was not disinclined to receive
us.&nbsp; This done, we departed under strict injunctions to
proceed through Pirna, a town which, as it was completely out of
our route, we never took any pains to reach.&nbsp; How we escaped
punishment for this infraction of police directions I scarcely
know, but we heard no more of the matter.&nbsp; When we had
already passed through the most romantic portion of Saxon
Switzerland, and were slowly descending to the plain, we met a
poor, footsore wanderer, with a woe-begone visage, who proved to
be the dejected object of official vengeance.&nbsp; Four days
before, he had started from Dresden full of life and hope, but on
arriving at the frontier town of Peterswald, it was discovered
that he had neglected to obtain the signature of one of the
numerous gentlemen of whose existence he was scarcely even
cognizant, and so was driven back to Dresden to seek the required
attestation, with loss of time, loss of money, and almost
broken-hearted.</p>
<p>When we reached the Saxon frontier our little party, by the
addition of other tramps, had increased to the number of ten; and
<!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>we leaped the boundary line at word of command, and
stood on Austrian territory.&nbsp; We had been warned of a
rigorous search for letters and tobacco at Peterswald, and as we
had made due arrangements for the visitation, we felt somewhat
slighted at our knapsacks being passed over with little better
than contempt.&nbsp; We had slept upon hay the previous night,
but upon our arrival at T&ouml;plitz, which we entered in a
cabriolet, three of us inside with five knapsacks, and other two
companions hanging on behind, we boldly took up our abode at one
of the first hotels, and were, the whole five of us, crammed into
a little room on the top floor, and charged a zwanziger
(eightpence) a head for the accommodation.&nbsp; We looked upon
this charge as little short of a robbery.&nbsp; On the following
day we approached Prague, and I got a lift in a waggon, of about
ten miles, and then laid down by the city gates till my four
friends should come up.&nbsp; Upon presenting ourselves at the
wicket, we were challenged by the sentinel, our passes taken from
us by the military guard, and a sort of receipt given for
them.&nbsp; Our three companions having only wander-books, were
imperiously directed to their herberge for accommodation, while
we were permitted to consult our own tastes upon the
matter.&nbsp; Of course we accompanied our friends.&nbsp; The
herberge gained, we descended by a stone step to the common room,
a vaulted chamber half under ground, very ill lighted, and
provided only with a few rude tables and benches.&nbsp; We called
for beer, being weary and thirsty, (the Praguer beer is
especially good) and requested a private room for our
party.&nbsp; The hostess, a fat, vulgar woman, being called by
the astonished servant maid, sneered at our presumption, and said
we must content ourselves with common tramps&rsquo;
lodging.&nbsp; We submitted; but the Viennese, who had a visit of
some importance to pay in the city, and wished to remove some of
the stains of travel, and make himself generally presentable,
having requested some simple means of making his toilet, was,
after considerable delay, presented with water in a pint mug, and
a soiled neckcloth as a towel.&nbsp; This was too much for the
Austrian&rsquo;s proud stomach; a storm of abuse in the richest
Viennese dialect was poured forth upon the landlady, her maid,
and the whole establishment, which being liberally responded to,
there resulted an uproar of foul language, such as was seldom
heard, even in those regions.&nbsp; The hostess threatened us
with the vengeance of the police, should we attempt to leave our
authorised herberge, to which we replied by tossing the beer into
the kennel, <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>buckling on our knapsacks, and
stalking into the street.&nbsp; We soon found a decent hotel,
with the accommodation of a large room containing five beds, and
at so reasonable a price that my whole expenses of entertainment
during the two days and three nights of our stay in Prague,
amounted only to one florin and forty kreutzers (schein), or one
shilling and sixpence.&nbsp; We heard no more of our Bohemian
herberge and its landlady.&nbsp; I may mention as a further proof
of the different treatment which awaits the holder of the
workman&rsquo;s wander-book, as compared with the bearer of a
passport, that on attending at the police office, Alcibiade and
myself were at once called into the bureau, and our duly
<i>vis&eacute;d</i> passports handed to us with great politeness,
while our companions were left to cool their heels in a stone
paved hall, till the officials could find time to attend to
them.&nbsp; We soon left Prague, and were assisted on our journey
towards Br&uuml;nn by a lift in a country cart, which brought us
fifty English miles forward on our road.&nbsp; We did not sleep
in a bed during four consecutive nights; not, indeed, till we
reached the village of Goldentraum, on the Moravian
frontier.&nbsp; This was not the result of any wish of our own,
but from an apparent deficiency of beds in that part of the
country.&nbsp; On one occasion a heap of hay was delicately
covered with a clean white cloth, lest the stubbly ends should
trouble our slumbers&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s attention you may be
sure&mdash;while on another, we slept on the bare boards, with no
other pillows than our knapsacks, in a room, the air of which was
at fever heat from recent bread-baking, and where the fierce
flies made circular sweeps at our ears, and droned about our
nostrils.&nbsp; But we did sleep in spite of that, for we had
tramped more than thirty miles during the day.</p>
<p>From Goldentraum there were still twenty English miles to
Br&uuml;nn, the capital of Moravia, and thence thirty-eight
German stunden, or about eighty English miles, to Vienna.&nbsp;
My funds were now reduced to about four shillings, and we had
still one hundred miles before us.&nbsp; One of our L&uuml;becker
silversmiths, who had been ailing throughout the whole journey,
was unable to proceed further on foot, and we left him at
Goldenstraun to take a place in the eilwagen later in the
day.&nbsp; We had, however, scarcely made half our journey, when
Alcibiade and the Viennese also gave in&mdash;their feet were
fearfully blistered&mdash;and seated themselves by the road-side
to await the expected conveyance.&nbsp; The remaining
L&uuml;becker, whom we had called Hannibal, and myself tramped on
to Br&uuml;nn.&nbsp; On the morrow <!-- page xv--><a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>we traced out
our three friends, but found them still so lame that they were
resolved to take the railway to Vienna at an expense of three
guldens (m&uuml;ntz), about six shillings each.&nbsp; As my own
resources were reduced to less than half that sum, and those of
Hannibal were in much the same condition, there remained to us
two only a choice of evils: either to borrow the requisite
amount, or to tramp the remaining distance on our diminished
finances.&nbsp; We chose the latter course.&nbsp; We walked the
eighty miles between Br&uuml;nn and Vienna in two days and a
half, subsisting chiefly on bread and fruit&mdash;pears and
plums, which were very plentiful&mdash;and long pulls at the
pumps.&nbsp; We were once induced to indulge in a half seidle
(pint) of wine, which was offered at a temptingly low price, but
found it of such a muddy and sour quality, that we bitterly
repented of our bargain.</p>
<p>When within a few miles of Vienna, having been on the march
since five in the morning, we laid down on the road-side to
sleep.&nbsp; It was with something like grief that I felt myself
forced to abandon one pair of boots, a few miles before
Vienna.&nbsp; I had brought them from London, and they had done
me good service; but now, with split and ragged fronts, and
scarcely a sole, they were only a torture to my feet, and a long
way past repair.&nbsp; I perched them on a little hillock with
their toes pointing towards Vienna, and turned round more than
once as we advanced, to give another farewell look to such
faithful and long companions.</p>
<p>After a refreshing sleep on the road-side, we entered Vienna
early in the afternoon.&nbsp; Hannibal was no richer than I was,
and my whole stock consisted of six groschens, a sum equal to
threepence.</p>
<h3>VIENNA.</h3>
<p>My first notes in Vienna must undoubtedly be devoted to the
police.&nbsp; As Hannibal and I arrived at the guard-house of the
Tabor Linie, or barrier, we were ordered by the sentinel to halt
and hand over our papers; and, upon doing so, received a slip of
very little better than sugar paper in return, with printed
directions in German, French, and Italian, commanding our
attendance at the chief police office within twenty-four
hours.&nbsp; We knew better than <!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>to
disobey.&nbsp; On the following morning we presented ourselves
and handed in our tickets, when mine was returned to me with the
words: &ldquo;Three days&rsquo; residence,&rdquo; written on the
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And should I not obtain employment in three
days?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you must leave
Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannibal was permitted greater licence, being a native of one
of the states of the Bund; but both he and his fellow-townsmen of
L&uuml;beck were taken into fictitious employment, in order to
obtain the necessary residence-card.&nbsp; Alcibiade, as a
Frenchman, and, moreover, as being still possessed of a certain
amount of hard cash, was also more leniently dealt with.&nbsp;
Not having found work on the fourth day I waited again upon the
police, and was at first peremptorily ordered to depart; but,
upon explaining that I had friends in the city, a further stay of
fourteen days was promised, on the production of a written
recommendation.&nbsp; On the following day, through the
friendship of our Viennese companion of the road, I found work at
a small shop-keeper&rsquo;s in the suburb of Maria-hilf.&nbsp;
Mark the routine.&nbsp; From my new employer I received a written
attestation of my engagement; with this I waited upon the police
commissioner of the district for his signature, and thence to the
magistrate of the suburb to obtain the authority of his name to
the act.&nbsp; This done, I was in a position to face the head
police authorities in the city, and they, to my astonishment,
doled out a six weeks&rsquo; permission of residence only, and
charged me a gulden, two shillings, for the document.&nbsp; I
pleaded my position as a workman, but was answered that my
passport was that of a merchant.&nbsp; This was disproved by
every entry on its broad sheet, more especially by a written
description by the magistrate of Perleberg, Prussia.&nbsp; All
remonstrances were, however, in vain: while unemployed they had
dealt with me as a workman without resources; now that I was
under engagement, they taxed me like a proprietor.&nbsp;
Alcibiade at once furnished the means of meeting this new
difficulty, as, indeed, of every other connected with our
finances at this period, and we consoled ourselves with the
assurance that one of us at least was in employment.&nbsp; Our
disgust was only equalled by our despondency when, upon reaching
home, we were met with the news that my new Herr refused to
complete his engagement, having met with an old workman whom he
preferred to a stranger.&nbsp; By law he was bound to furnish me
with a fortnight&rsquo;s work, and I threatened him with an
enforcement of my claim; but I knew I <!-- page xvii--><a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>should
come off the worse in the struggle, and submitted to the
injustice.</p>
<p>In the meantime two of our silversmiths were under fictitious
engagements&mdash;a common occurrence, and almost excusable under
the circumstances&mdash;and were dining upon credit.&nbsp; The
times were bad.&nbsp; I did not really commence work till the
fourth week, and Alcibiade a week later.&nbsp; But, these first
difficulties overcome, our condition improved daily; and for
myself I can say with gratitude, that nowhere in Germany was I
more happy than in Vienna.&nbsp; Our position was this: Alcibiade
was engaged as a diamond jeweller at a weekly sum of six guldens,
or twelve shillings, a little more than half the sum he had
earned in Berlin; but no doubt, had he remained longer in the
Austrian capital, he would have increased his rate of pay.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, after three months&rsquo; stay there came word
from Paris requiring his presence by a certain day at the
military court of the department of Seine et Oise, to which,
being a native of Argenteuil, he belonged, to draw for the
conscription.&nbsp; Alcibiade was too good a Frenchman to
hesitate about obeying this summons, or even to murmur at the
sacrifice it demanded of him.&nbsp; He left Vienna with regret,
but with the utmost alacrity; and thus I lost for a time my best
companion and sincerest friend.&nbsp; My first essay as a workman
in Vienna was discouraging, for I undertook, in my extremity, to
execute work to which I was unaccustomed, and made such
indifferent progress at the outset, that the Herr, a Russian from
St. Petersburg, would only pay me five guldens, or ten shillings
a week.&nbsp; We worked twelve hours a day, commencing at six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning in summer time; but there were a
number of f&ecirc;te and saint days in the year, which were paid
for&mdash;I think eight in all&mdash;including St. Leopold, the
patron saint of Vienna; the birth of the Virgin; <i>Corpus
Christi Die</i>, and other church holidays.&nbsp; As I improved
in the practice of my new branch of business, I gained additions
to my wages, till I received nine gulden, eighteen shillings, a
week; a sum certainly much above the average pay.</p>
<p>Alcibiade and I lodged in a narrow slip of a room, the last of
a suite of three, on the first floor of a house, or rather
conglomerate of houses, in the Neudegger Gasse,
Josephstadt.&nbsp; Our landlord was a worthy Bohemian
cabinet-maker; his wife, a Viennese, who kept everything in the
neatest order.&nbsp; I do not know how many families lived in
this house; but it was a huge parallelogram with a paved
courtyard, in the centre of which stood a wooden pump.&nbsp;
There was <!-- page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>a common stair in each corner, all
of stone, and a common closet at the bottom of each staircase,
equally of stone, seat and all, and very common indeed.&nbsp;
Each lodging consisted of three continuous rooms, with only one
entrance from the common stair: first was the kitchen, with
cooking apparatus, and the oven, which warmed the whole suite;
then a larger room with two windows, at once workshop,
dining-room, and bed-room; and beyond this the narrow closet with
one window, which was our dormitory.&nbsp; Thus we had to pass
through our landlord&rsquo;s bed-room to get to our own.&nbsp;
The other portions of the building were arranged much in the same
manner, and the house must have had, in all, at least a hundred
inhabitants.&nbsp; There are much larger houses in the suburbs of
Vienna, but they are all built upon the same principle, with
trifling modifications.&nbsp; Here are two cards of address,
which are models of exactness in their way, and will illustrate
the nature of these barracks in the best possible manner:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Joseph Uberlachner</span>,<br />
Master Tailor,</p>
<p>Lives in the Wieden, in the Lumpertsgasse, next to the
Suspension bridge, No. 831, the left hand staircase on the second
floor, door No. 31.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Martin
Spies</span>,<br />
Men&rsquo;s Tailor,</p>
<p>Lives in Neubau, St&uuml;ckgosse, No 149, in the courtyard,
the right hand staircase, on the second floor, door on the left
hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entrance to our house from the street was small and
unimportant, and, as may naturally be supposed, always
open.&nbsp; The law was, however, strict upon this subject, and
permitted the house to be open in summer from five in the morning
till ten o&rsquo;clock at night only; in winter from seven till
nine.&nbsp; There was a little room opening from the passage,
where dwelt the porter of the mansion.&nbsp; It was his duty to
close the door at the appointed hours; a duty which he
scrupulously fulfilled, seeing that the law empowered him to levy
a fine of six kreutzers for his own especial benefit, upon every
inhabitant or stranger seeking egress or ingress after the
authorised hour of closing.&nbsp; The Viennese insist upon it
that this impost is recoverable by law; but, as the
porter&rsquo;s whole existence depends upon the employment of his
labour in and about the house, and therefore upon the good-will
of its inhabitants, he takes care in general not to be too
pressing for his toll.</p>
<p><!-- page xix--><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>Our dormitory, diminutive as it appeared, still managed
to contain two single bedsteads (French), a wash-hand-stand,
wardrobe, used in common by landlord and lodgers, a table, and
two chairs.&nbsp; We paid in rent twelve florins a month, or
barely ten shillings between us; add to this, for washing,
candles, and morning coffee (a tiny cup at six in the morning,
before starting to work), another four florins, and our united
expenses for these necessaries did not exceed thirteen shillings
per month.&nbsp; As in Berlin, we dined at a
&ldquo;restauration,&rdquo; or at the &ldquo;Fress
Madam&rsquo;s&rdquo; (Mrs. Gobble&rsquo;s), a jocose term for a
private eating-house, well known to the jewellers.&nbsp; The
mid-day meal of the Viennese workman is remarkable for strength
and solidity, but also for its sameness.&nbsp; It always takes
the shape of fresh boiled beef and vegetables, the latter
arranged in a thick porridge of meal and fat.&nbsp; It commences,
of course, with soup; is followed by the &ldquo;rind-fleisch and
gemuse,&rdquo; as above; and, if you can afford it, is concluded
by some such sweet dish as flour puddings stewed with prunes, a
common sort of cake called zwieback, omelette, macaroni, or a
lighter kind of cake, baked and eaten with jam.&nbsp; All solid,
wholesome, and of the best.&nbsp; There is a choice of other more
relishing dishes, and of these we usually partook, with an
occasional descent into the regions of beef and greens.&nbsp;
Vienna prides itself upon its baked chickens and Danube carps,
but these were beyond our reach on ordinary occasions; and our
usual delectation was upon Augsburger sausages; bacon and sour
kraut; breaded veal cutlets; ditto lamb&rsquo;s head; and roasted
liver and onions.&nbsp; When we drank the ordinary white wine, we
did so much diluted.&nbsp; To sup at the
&ldquo;restauration&rdquo; would have entailed too great an
expense; we therefore contented ourselves with bread and a taste
of butter at home, moistened by a glass of a liquor resembling
gin, seeing that it was made of the juniper berry, which our
landlord obtained for us at about tenpence a quart.&nbsp; It was
supposed to be smuggled from Hungary, and Vater B&ouml;hm
coloured and sweetened it with molasses, and called it
Schlipowitzer.</p>
<p>Our weekly outlay for food during the first month of residence
in Vienna, especially while unemployed, did not exceed five
florins, <i>i.e.</i> four shillings each.&nbsp; We ate bread and
fruit in large quantities; indeed, during one day my
&ldquo;rations&rdquo; consisted of: breakfast at eight, half of a
coarse loaf and thirty plums; at twelve, one dozen pears and the
other half of the loaf; at seven a whole loaf, and forty more
plums.&nbsp; Cost of the whole, nine kreutzers (schein), or <!--
page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>scarcely three halfpence in English money.&nbsp; It was
not surprising that I should fall ill upon this diet, and this I
accordingly did.&nbsp; When, however, we were in constant work,
we lived as I have already described, and at an average expense
of seven florins&mdash;five shillings and tenpence each
weekly&mdash;and thus the individual outlay for lodging, food,
and other necessaries, was, in round numbers, seven shillings and
sixpence a week.&nbsp; A dinner on New Year&rsquo;s Day, of baked
pork and fried potatoes, with bread, wine, and apple puffs, cost
ninepence.</p>
<p>To return to the police.&nbsp; When my six weeks&rsquo;
permission of residence was expired, I attended again at the
chief office in the Stadt, with the certificate of my employer,
signed and countersigned by police-commissioner and magistrate,
and was granted thereon a further term of three months at the
same fee, two shillings; to me at that time a day&rsquo;s
wages.&nbsp; Subsequently, however, the &ldquo;Herr,&rdquo; by
means of a further attestation, with vouchers from the landlord
of the house, and the usual official signatures, obtained for me
a card of residence for six months, gratis, and I experienced no
more trouble on that head.&nbsp; This, and the various other
certificates, were upon stamped paper of the value of six
kreutzers, or one penny.&nbsp; While upon this subject I may
observe, that domestic servants must make known to the police
every change of service.&nbsp; They are hired by the month.&nbsp;
Change of residence is also a matter of official interference: a
printed sheet is handed to the new lodger, with spaces for name,
age, country, religion, condition, married or single, where last
resided, and probable length of stay in new apartments.&nbsp; All
these particulars must be stated and signed, witnessed by your
own particular landlord, and attested by the landlord of the
house.&nbsp; The document is then deposited in the archives of
the district police.</p>
<p>At the termination of my first year&rsquo;s stay in Germany, I
found that my receipts in wages, during the twelve months,
amounted to twenty-one pounds six shillings and fourpence, an
average of eight shillings and twopence-halfpenny per week; but
it must be remembered that, during nine months of that period,
board and lodging formed part of my remuneration.&nbsp; I stayed
a full year in Vienna, and received in wages, in all, three
hundred and sixty-two guldens, thirty kreutzers, or thirty-six
pounds five shillings.&nbsp; This would give, in round numbers,
fourteen shillings per week throughout the year.&nbsp; Of this
sum, as I have said, seven shillings and sixpence were on an
average spent weekly in lodging and necessary <!-- page xxi--><a
name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>food; there
therefore remained six shillings and sixpence for clothes,
amusements, and savings.</p>
<p>When the period arrived at which I had determined upon
starting on foot for Paris, my savings amounted to seven pounds
sterling, and with that sum I thought myself amply provided for
the journey.&nbsp; In order that it may not be supposed that I
had suffered undue privations, or enforced, in financial
arrangements, anything beyond a reasonable economy, I must state,
that in addition to paying to the Guild and police, during the
year, eight florins twelve kreutzers, or six shillings and
tenpence, I had witnessed twenty-three theatrical
representations, at prices varying from fourpence to a shilling,
at a total cost of eleven shillings and fourpence; been present
at eighteen concerts, at an outlay of seven shillings and
eightpence; and had visited the Br&uuml;hl, W&ouml;slau,
M&ouml;dlin, Laxenburg, Helena-Thal, Klosterneuburg, Grinzing,
and Weinhaus; the Treasure Chamber, and picture-galleries
innumerable; which latter, although supposed to be open to public
inspection free of expense, were not conveniently accessible
without a fee.&nbsp; Twenty-five kreutzers, or fourpence, was the
price of a seat in the gallery of the suburban theatres of the
Leopold, Joseph, and Wiener vorst&auml;dte; while tenpence and a
shilling procured a similar place in the imperial opera and
play-house.&nbsp; Hot sausages and beer were the luxuries vended
in the former; while ices, coffee, and delicate pastry, were the
<i>bonnes bouches</i> prepared for the latter.</p>
<p>I found the workmen in Vienna industrious and submissive; gay,
thoughtless, and kind-hearted.&nbsp; In some trades it was still
the practice for the workmen, if not numerous, to sleep in the
workshop.&nbsp; I knew a cabinet-maker who did so, and he was
very cleanly and well lodged.&nbsp; I knew one or two married
journeymen, and there were no doubt very many in so large a
capital as Vienna, but marriage among artisans was generally
condemned.&nbsp; The wages were on the average much less than I
have stated; I knew silversmiths who were earning only three and
four florins a week&mdash;six shillings and eight shillings; and
I have no doubt that tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, and others,
were paid even less.&nbsp; I visited one family circle in the
Leopoldstadt which consisted of the man, his wife and child, and
three single men lodgers, who all lived and slept in one
room.&nbsp; I found the lodgers airing themselves in the
court-yard, while the beds were made and the room set in
order.&nbsp; But I saw very little of squalor or filth even in
the poorest quarters.&nbsp; <!-- page xxii--><a
name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>As a
check upon the assumed thoughtlessness of the Viennese artisans,
the pawnbrokers are by civil ordinance closed a week before and
after every great holiday, such as Easter, Whitsuntide, etc.</p>
<p>There were very many small masters, known in England as
master-men, who worked at home, and by their skill and quickness
earned superior wages.&nbsp; My own landlord was one of them, and
called himself a &ldquo;Gallanterie Tischler.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
chiefly employed in ornamental woodwork for the silversmiths,
and, being tasty and expert, earned a very respectable
living.&nbsp; He used to buy English knives for certain parts of
his work, on account of the superiority of the steel, but he
complained bitterly of their clumsy and awkward fashion.&nbsp; He
was extremely industrious during the week, and many a pleasant
Sunday visit have we paid to Weinhaus and other suburban
villages, when the &ldquo;heueriger&rdquo;&mdash;the young,
half-made wine&mdash;was to be tasted.&nbsp; Heueriger was sold
at a few pence a quart, and is a whitish liquid of an acid but
not unpleasant flavour.&nbsp; It is a treacherous drink, like
most white wines, and from its apparently innocent character
tempts many into unexpected inebriation.&nbsp; The Viennese
delight in an Italian sausage called &ldquo;Salami,&rdquo; said
to be made of asses&rsquo; flesh, and a pale, but highly scented
cheese, as the proper accompaniments to the heueriger.</p>
<p>Domestic servants in Vienna have one very laborious duty to
perform, and that is the fetching of water from the
springs.&nbsp; These springs are simply pumps in appearance, and
were so formerly, but the flow of water is now continuous, and to
be obtained without effort.&nbsp; It is painful to see the poor
girls bending under the weight of their water troughs, which are
carried on the back, and shaped something like a pannier with a
flat side.&nbsp; They are made of wood, hooped like a barrel, and
have a close-fitting lid.&nbsp; The Bohemian women perform duties
even more unsuitable.&nbsp; They are bricklayers labourers; and
sift sand, mix mortar, and carry slates on their heads to the
highest houses.&nbsp; In these labours they are sometimes
assisted, or set aside, by the soldiery, the more well-behaved of
whom are allowed to hire themselves as labourers and
porters.&nbsp; In one case, as I know, a soldier was &ldquo;put
in possession,&rdquo; as his Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s
representative, and provided daily with a sum of money as an
equivalent for food.</p>
<p>There is another class of labourers who make themselves
particularly conspicuous in the streets of Vienna, and that is
the &ldquo;holzhacker,&rdquo; or wood-chopper.&nbsp; Wood is the
universal fuel, and <!-- page xxiii--><a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>is sold
in klafters, or stacks of six cubic feet.&nbsp; A klafter
consists of logs, each about three feet long, and apparently the
split quarters of young trees of a uniform size.&nbsp; This wood,
when delivered to the purchaser, is shot upon the footpath in
front of the house, or in the court-yard, if there be a porte
coch&ecirc;re, which is not usual.&nbsp; The business of the
holzhacker is to chop the logs into small pieces for the
convenience of burning, and this he does in an incredibly short
space of time, but to the great inconvenience and sometimes
personal risk of the passers by.&nbsp; He is, however, very
independent in his way, and is treated with astonishing
forbearance by the police.&nbsp; He is, moreover, the street wit
of Vienna.</p>
<p>The Viennese workmen are not merely uninformed of, but in
general, perfectly indifferent to political matters.&nbsp; This
ignorance may in a great measure result from the unthinking and
pleasure-seeking character of the Viennese public&mdash;which
levity is encouraged by the Government, as taverns and concert
rooms are open long after private houses are closed&mdash;but is
also to be traced to the uneasy position which the citizens hold
with respect to the police.&nbsp; It is not alone that the
restrictions and impediments of official routine render his
social existence a matter of public legislation, but there is an
unpleasant consciousness that his landlord, his neighbour on the
same flat, his barber, or his fellow workman, may be a
&ldquo;vertrauter,&rdquo; a spy in the pay of the police, and his
simplest actions, through their means, perverted into
misdemeanours.&nbsp; A worthy cooper, with whom I occasionally
dined, on reading a skeleton report of a public meeting in
England, where working men had made speeches and moved
resolutions, exclaimed, as he threw down the paper: &ldquo;But,
seriously, don&rsquo;t you think this very ridiculous?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>ON TRAMP TO PARIS.</h3>
<p>We were three in number, a jeweller from Copenhagen, a
Viennese silversmith, and myself, who started from Vienna to walk
to Paris.&nbsp; We were all in tolerable feather as to
funds.&nbsp; I was possessed of about seventy guldens (seven
pounds), and a little packet of fifty dozens of piercing-saws, a
trading speculation, which I hoped to smuggle over the French
frontier in my boots.&nbsp; I was better provided <!-- page
xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>in all respects than on any of my former
journeys.&nbsp; We had forwarded our boxes to Strassburg, our
knapsacks were light, and we wore stout walking shoes with
scarcely any heels, and had prepared some well-boiled linen
wrappers, intended, when smeared with tallow, to serve the
purpose of socks.&nbsp; They effectually prevent blisters, and
can be readily washed in any running stream.&nbsp; Our first
stage was by steam on the Danube to Linz, the capital of Upper
Austria; and we took our departure from Nussdorf amid the
valedictions and kisses of some thirty male friends, each of whom
saluted us thrice&mdash;on each cheek, and on the lips, for this
is the true German fashion, and may not be slighted or
avoided.</p>
<p>A voyage on the water may seem a curious commencement of a
foot journey; but the fact is, that no one knows better than the
tramp that a railway or a steamboat is always cheaper than
shoe-leather and time; and no doubt as these new means of
progress increase in number they will entirely change the
character of German trade-wanderings.&nbsp; From Vienna to Linz
is, in round numbers, a distance of one hundred and fifty English
miles, and this one vessel, the &ldquo;Karl,&rdquo; got over in
two days and a night.&nbsp; The wind was against us, and it must
be remembered that it is all up stream.&nbsp; The Danube is upon
the whole a melancholy river, of a sullen encroaching character,
for its whole course is marked by over-floodings and their
consequent desolation.&nbsp; The passage cost ten florins,
twenty-five kreutzers, or eight shillings and fourpence, and we
slept on the table below, on deck, or not at all, as we best
could.</p>
<p>Our real starting-point on tramp was Linz, whence we pursued
our way through Wells, Gmunden, Ebensee, and Ishl to Salzburg, in
which beautiful city we rested for a day and half.&nbsp; We
steamed across lake Traun from Gmunden, and paid a fare of
twenty-five kreutzers, or fourpence.&nbsp; From Salzburg we
pushed on to Hallein, to visit the salt mines there, and thence
diverged still further from the beaten route for the sake of
seeing the water-fall of Golling&mdash;the stern terrors of the
&OElig;fen&mdash;and dream away an hour upon the beautiful and
romantic waters of K&ouml;nigsee, the King&rsquo;s Lake.&nbsp; We
had crossed the frontier of Bavaria near Hallein, and, having
loitered so long among the delightful scenery of its
neighbourhood, we now hurried on towards Munich, through
Reichenhall, Fraunstein, Weisham, Rosenheim, Aibling, and
Peiss.&nbsp; Thirsty and weary, we overtook a timber waggon when
within eight miles of the capital, and made a bargain with the
driver to carry us forward to our <!-- page xxv--><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>destination
for six kreutzers, about one penny, each; and upon the unhewn
timber of the springless log-waggon we rode into Munich.&nbsp; We
had been already fourteen days upon the road, ten of which had
been spent on tramp, advancing at an average rate of twenty-five
miles a day.&nbsp; From Linz to Munich, by the circuitous route
we had taken, I reckon in round numbers at two hundred and fifty
miles.&nbsp; My share of the expenses amounted to thirty-six
florins, forty kreutzers, say one pound nine shillings in English
money, or an average outlay of two shillings a day.&nbsp; It may
be added, that many of our expenses were those of ordinary
foot-tourists, rather than of tramping workmen; that we had lived
well although frugally; and that, save in a goatherd&rsquo;s hut
on the Schaf-berg, we had never slept out of bed.</p>
<p>We spent five happy days in Munich: wandering among
picture-galleries and museums; visiting the royal palace in the
capital, and the pleasure retreat at Nymphenburg; and the
churches, with their painted windows, beautiful architecture, and
radiant frescoes.&nbsp; We visited two theatres, and roamed in
the English garden, and among the wilder scenery of hills in the
environs.&nbsp; Munich is the real capital of modern art, and
contains more magnificent public buildings than any city of the
same extent in the world.&nbsp; Vulgar figures again: my expenses
in Munich amounted to eight guldens, forty kreutzers, Bavarian or
Reich&rsquo;s money, which will yield, as nearly as the
intricacies of German coinage will allow of the calculation,
fifteen shillings and fourpence.&nbsp; The fare by railway from
Munich to Augsburg, our next station, was one gulden, twenty-four
kreutzers,&mdash;two shillings and fourpence,&mdash;and from the
latter fine old city we proceeded entirely on foot to
Strassburg.&nbsp; We took the road through Ulm, Stutgard,
Heilbron, Heidelberg, Manheim, Carlsruhe, Baden-Baden, and Keil;
wandering a little from the beaten path near Kissengan to see the
beautiful waterworks and garden there.&nbsp; These cities have
all been described by innumerable travellers, and I doubt whether
I could add anything to the knowledge already possessed of
them.</p>
<p>We had passed fifteen days upon the road, and traversed a
distance, roughly estimated, of two hundred and fifty
miles.&nbsp; We rested in all four days in the towns of Augsburg,
Ulm, Heidelberg, (of glorious recollection), and Carlsruhe; and
thus, during the ten days of actual tramp, we had advanced at an
average rate of twenty-five miles a day.&nbsp; Since leaving
Vienna, we had walked five hundred miles.&nbsp; <!-- page
xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>On one occasion only did we march more than thirty
miles in the day.&nbsp; This was between Stutgard and
Heilbron.&nbsp; As we limped wearily through the latter city, we
came upon a tavern at the sign of the Eagle, and inquiring, like
cautious travellers, the price of a bed, we found it was twelve
kreutzers Reich&rsquo;s money, fourpence.&nbsp; This was beyond
our mark, so we tottered onward to the Stag, where we were very
indifferently lodged for half the money.&nbsp; At Heidelberg we
paid twelve kreutzers for our bed, and were well accommodated;
but this was more by four kreutzers than we considered ourselves
in a position to pay.&nbsp; Our average expenses per day, while
on tramp at this period, were twenty-four kreutzers, or
eightpence.&nbsp; My total outlay from Munich to Strassburg was
twenty-one florins, ten kreutzers, or one pound five shillings;
being at the rate of one shilling and sixpence a day.</p>
<p>It may be right to mention, that a German mile is divided into
two stunden, or hours, and the natural inference would be, that
it would occupy two hours to walk a mile.&nbsp; This is not the
case, for a stunden can generally be traversed in three quarters
of an hour; but the German miles are not uniform, and I well
remember one terribly long one between Br&uuml;nn and Vienna,
which was more than two hours walk.&nbsp; As three English miles
an hour is an average walking pace, a German mile, occupying on
the average an hour and a half in the traverse, should be equal
to four and a half English miles, and this is the rate at which I
have estimated it, although I have seen it variously stated at
less than four, and even at five English miles.</p>
<p>While on tramp, we rose at five in the morning, and walked
till eight fasting, when we took breakfast&mdash;a simple affair
of milk, or of coffee and plain bread, with occasionally a little
meat as a luxury&mdash;we then proceeded on our march till
twelve, always supposing that a town or village was at such a
distance as to render the arrangement possible, when we
dined.&nbsp; This meal consisted invariably of soup&mdash;milk
soup, if possible, peppered and salted like broth&mdash;and
sometimes meat, but not always, as it was dear, and supposed to
be heavy for walking.&nbsp; As by this time the sun was in its
zenith, and our advance in the great heat would be most
fatiguing, and even dangerous, we laid ourselves down to rest
till three, in the open air if possible, and weather permitting;
out on the fields among the corn; stretched upon the hay in some
shady nook; or, as in Bavaria and Wurtemberg during a great part
of the route, under the apple <!-- page xxvii--><a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>and
plum trees which lined the public way, eating of the fruit
unquestioned and without restraint.&nbsp; After this welcome
repose we pursued our march with renewed animation till eight
o&rsquo;clock, when we sought out a place of rest; and for our
evening meal usually indulged in something more substantial than
at any other time of the day.&nbsp; Our beds were not always
clean, and the lavatorial necessaries either deficient or wholly
wanting, in which latter case the pump was our only
substitute.</p>
<p>Our brief stays in towns or cities were by no means the least
fatiguing part of our journey; for it naturally happened that in
our anxiety to see whatever was remarkable or beautiful, in
museum, picture-gallery, or public building, that our time was
tasked even more severely than on the road; always remembering
also, that the police required a great deal of attention.&nbsp;
My passport has fourteen distinct <i>visas</i> during this
journey.&nbsp; We found the police in Bavaria the least civil
among a very exacting class of people.&nbsp; Here, for the first
time, I heard a mode of address which is, I think, peculiar to
Germany.&nbsp; It is customary to address strangers in the third
person plural, <i>Se</i>; or, when on very familiar or
affectionate terms, in the second person singular, <i>Du</i>; but
of all modes of speech the third person singular, <i>Er</i>, when
applied to the person addressed, is the most opprobrious.&nbsp; A
police official thus interrogates a wandering workman:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A currier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Siegesdorf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ulm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he got the itch?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let him sign this book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Augsburg the police were in a dilemma with respect to
us.&nbsp; We had come by rail from Munich, and, to our surprise,
were suffered to pass through the gate unchallenged by the
sentinel, who paced leisurely before the guard-house.&nbsp; The
following morning, on presenting our papers at the police-bureau,
we were met with the accusation of having smuggled ourselves into
the city; and, as the usual official routine had been departed
from, we were ordered to proceed at once to the gates, and humbly
deliver up our passports to the sentinel in due form, that the
requirements of the law might be fulfilled.&nbsp; This sage
proposition was, however, overruled in consideration of our being
jewellers: the respectability of the craft being thus
acknowledged.&nbsp; It was in Augsburg also that I narrowly <!--
page xxviii--><a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>escaped being entered in the books of the Guild as
&ldquo;Mr. Great Britain, native of London;&rdquo; the slim
apprentice whose duty it was to make the entry, having mistaken
the name of the country for that of the individual in my English
passport.</p>
<p>I may not omit to mention, although I do it with a feeling of
humiliation, that during our journey we availed ourselves of
whatever assistance was granted by the Guild to &ldquo;wandering
boys&rdquo; unable to obtain employment.&nbsp; We had a perfect
right to this aid, and had, while in work, always contributed to
the fund (in which we had, indeed, no option); but I must confess
that there was something exceedingly like asking for alms in the
whole process of obtaining it.&nbsp; Our slender resources must
plead as an excuse.&nbsp; The following were our individual
receipts: in Linz, twenty-four kreutzers; in Munich, thirty-six;
Augsburg, eighteen; Ulm, fifteen; Stutgard, thirty; Heilbron,
twenty-four; Heidelberg, nine, (begged from shop to shop, there
being no general cash-box); and Carlsruhe, twenty-four; making a
total of one hundred and eighty kreutzers, or the munificent sum
of two shillings and sixpence in English money.&nbsp; What must
be the fate of those whose dependence was upon such a
pittance!</p>
<p>I had passed two whole years and a few days in Germany, and
during a period of eighty-eight weeks, had been fully at
work.&nbsp; I had received fifty-six pounds thirteen shillings in
wages, or an average, throughout the whole term, of eleven
shillings per week.&nbsp; I felt grateful for this result in a
strange country, and left Germany with a lingering step.</p>
<p>As we crossed over the bridge of Kiel on our way to
Strassburg, the French soldiery were quietly fishing on their
side of the Rhine, and the sentinel, from whom we had expected a
harsh summons to the guard-house, and a rigorous search into our
knapsacks, eyed us with a look of half pity, half contempt, and
allowed us to pass unchallenged.&nbsp; We were, to him, only so
many miserable &ldquo;square-heads&rdquo; (Germans) on our way to
Paris.&nbsp; The curiosities of Strassburg need not detain me:
the cathedral, and the wonderful clock; the theatre, which we
visited; the fortifications, which we overlooked from the lofty
spire; those things are set down in every traveller&rsquo;s
guidebook, and the recollection of them is probably much more
agreeable to me than their description would be to the
reader.&nbsp; We had resolved not to tramp through France, and we
therefore sought places in the diligence; and by the time I had
paid forty-three <!-- page xxix--><a name="pagexxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>francs for my seat in that
respectable vehicle, and ten francs for the carriage of my box
from Vienna to Strassburg, together with two francs for a
passeport provisoire; and by the time also that I had paid some
two francs more for extra luggage, including two loaves and a
string of six Strassburger sausages, which were all included in
the weight, I found that I should arrive in Paris with less than
five francs in my pocket.&nbsp; And this I accordingly did, after
a very uncomfortable ride of fifty-two hours, and within a day of
six weeks from our departure from Vienna.</p>
<h3>PARIS.</h3>
<p>We thought ourselves very ill-used on our first night in
Paris, when, having been wiled into a grand hotel near the
Bourse, we were stowed away on the fifth floor, three in a room,
and charged six francs for our beds, one more for a candle, and
one for service.&nbsp; Our parsimonious Dane was so highly
irritated, that he took possession of the candle and carried it
off in his pocket.&nbsp; But Alcibiade was soon by our side, to
give us help and advice with his old kindness; and under his
guidance we removed immediately to more suitable lodgings, and
were set in the proper course to obtain employment.&nbsp;
Although scarcely possessed of a single franc in actual cash, I
had fifty dozens of fine piercing-saws, my contraband
speculation, and for which I ultimately obtained about twenty
francs.&nbsp; What was of more importance, in less than a week
from our arrival in Paris I commenced work at the modest
remuneration of four francs and a half, three shillings and
ninepence, a day.&nbsp; My two companions were scarcely so
fortunate, but lingered on for a week or two without
employment.</p>
<p>I found myself in a motley company; at one time our
at&eacute;lier contained three Russians, two Germans, two
Englishmen, an Italian, and a Frenchman; and sometimes a simple
inquiry would have to pass through four languages before it
received its answer.&nbsp; I did not remain long amid this babel,
although long enough to be offered six francs a day to
remain.&nbsp; I never afterwards worked for a less rate of
remuneration than six francs a day, but never succeeded in
obtaining a sous more.&nbsp; I had many &ldquo;Patrons&rdquo; in
Paris.&nbsp; In one establishment there were three workmen
continually employed <!-- page xxx--><a name="pagexxx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>in making crosses of honour, in gold
and silver, to reward the merit, or to purchase the affection and
support, of the French people.&nbsp; I was variously employed: in
gold work; in setting small rose-diamonds; and upon the most
costly brilliant ornaments.&nbsp; Sometimes idling upon three
days a week, or totally unemployed; at other times slaving night
and day, Sunday and all, to complete some urgent order.&nbsp; I
have worked nineteen days in a fortnight.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to give some details with regard to the
manner of living, working, and lodging, among the labouring
population of Paris, under the head of &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The French Workman</span>;&rdquo; and which details
were in most part personal, or such as I had learned from actual
experience.&nbsp; My business here is with results, and I will
condense them into as few words as possible.&nbsp; I stayed in
all one year and five months in Paris, during the whole of which
period I was never out of a situation, although at various times
but scantily provided with employment.&nbsp; I received in wages
a total of two thousand three hundred and one francs, thirteen
sous, or ninety-two pounds two shillings and
twopence-halfpenny.&nbsp; This would give an average receipt,
upon the seventy-one weeks of my stay, of one pound three
shillings and three-halfpence a week.&nbsp; I have said that
during the greater part of this time I earned at the rate of six
francs, or five shillings a day; if I now give the current
expenses per week, a comparison may from these data be drawn as
to the comparative position of the English and French
workman.&nbsp; The usual outlay for food per week amounted to
twelve francs, or ten shillings, of course with fluctuations; for
I have lived a whole week upon five francs when unemployed, and
have luxuriated upon twenty when in full work.&nbsp; Upon
striking a balance among my various lodgings,&mdash;I lodged in
company and slept double during the whole period of my stay in
Paris&mdash;I find the result to be, that we paid twelve francs
each per month, or two shillings and sixpence per week.&nbsp;
This did not include extras: a German stove hired at five francs
a month for the winter season; wood at four francs the hundred
pounds weight; candles at thirteen sous the pound, and soap at a
fraction less.&nbsp; Nor does it include the half franc to the
concierge, an obligatory payment upon presenting yourself at the
street-door after midnight.&nbsp; Summing up these items, we
arrive at this result: for food, ten shillings; rent, two
shillings and sixpence; and miscellaneous necessaries, including
twelve sous for washing, of another two <!-- page xxxi--><a
name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>shillings
and sixpence; or a total of fifteen shillings of expenditure
against, in my case, of one pound three shillings and odd pence
of income.&nbsp; The cost of pleasure in the French capital must
not be omitted; and I feel bound to state that twenty-seven
visits to the theatres, from the pit of the Italian Opera House
at four francs, to the same place at the Vaudeville for eighteen
sous; and thirteen public balls and concerts, from the grand
masked ball to that of the &ldquo;Grande Chaumi&egrave;re,&rdquo;
were met by an outlay of sixty-eight francs thirteen sous, or
three pounds seven shillings and tenpence-halfpenny.</p>
<p>After an absence of nearly three years and a half, I turned my
steps towards home.&nbsp; From the time that I had crossed the
French frontier, and, upon delivering my papers, had received a
passeport provisoire at Strassburg, I had never sustained cheque
or molestation from the police; but now that I was about to
depart, and made the usual application for my original passport,
it was discovered that, as a workman, I should have had a
&ldquo;livret&rdquo; upon my first entering Paris, and a number
of certificates and attestations were required, in order to
reinstate me in a legitimate position in the eyes of the
law.&nbsp; Escaped from this dilemma, and officially recognised
as <i>ouvrier</i>, it was with some surprise that I found myself
dubbed gentleman at the Bureau des Affaires Etrang&eacute;res,
and charged a fee of ten franca for the signature of the foreign
minister.&nbsp; Too old a traveller to be entrapped into the
payment of so heavy a fine upon my vanity, I strongly repudiated
any more pretentious title than that of simple workman; and after
a tough struggle succeeded in carrying off the necessary visa at
an outlay of two francs.&nbsp; The journey, by diligence, from
Paris to Boulogne, cost twenty-seven francs; I lost a clear six
francs in changing my French savings into English
gold&mdash;twelve sovereigns&mdash;and, after a rough passage by
the Boulogne boat to London, at an expense of twelve francs,
found myself once more in my native city.</p>
<p>Let those who would estimate the value of such an enterprise
as mine, consider its cost and its result.&nbsp; I had passed
several years in foreign travel; I had undeniably profited in the
acquisition of new experiences in my trade; new modes of working,
and additional manual skill.&nbsp; I had rubbed off some of the
most valued, and therefore most absurd, prejudices against
foreigners; and made some progress in the acquisition of two
languages&mdash;a gain which must ever be a source of mental
profit and gratification.&nbsp; To conclude: I had <!-- page
xxxii--><a name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxii</span>started on my journey but indifferently clad, and
with scarcely five pounds in my pocket, of which sum two pounds
had been remitted home; and I had been able not merely to subsist
by the labor of my hands, but to enjoy much that was costly, and
an infinite deal more that was pleasurable and advantageous; and
to return home, having liquidated every debt, save that of
gratitude, well provided with apparel, and with ten pounds
sterling in my purse.</p>
<p>I would not venture to urge upon any man to follow in my
footsteps.&nbsp; I should scarcely retrace them myself under the
same conditions; but I believe I have shown the practicability of
such an undertaking, and its probability of success, with no more
unusual qualifications than a ready hand, a patient will, and
some perseverance.</p>
<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">hamburg</span>.</p>
<p>Hamburg at last!&mdash;after eight days&rsquo; sail from
London, three of them spent in knocking about the North Sea,
where the wind always blows in your teeth.&nbsp; Never mind! we
are now safely moored to these substantial timbers; huge piles,
driven in a line, which form the outer harbour of Hamburg.&nbsp;
The city lies before us, but there is nothing very imposing in
it; the houses, with gable roofs and whitened walls, look rather
lath-and-plastery, in fact; but we must not express our opinions
too rashly, for first impressions are not always the most
faithful after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, is the boat ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We scramble down the sides of the British schooner, the
&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; and seat ourselves along with Tom.&nbsp;
What a confusion of boats, long-pointed barges, and small sailing
vessels!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind how you go, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; replies Tom, contemptuously
shifting his quid.</p>
<p>These small sailing vessels we see are from the Hanoverian and
Danish coasts.&nbsp; Their cargoes consist principally of wood,
and whole stacks of vegetables, the latter ridiculously
small.&nbsp; Those long-pointed barges are for canal navigation,
and are admirably adapted to Hamburg, threaded as it is by canals
in every direction.</p>
<p>Steady!&nbsp; Do you see that curious, turret-looking
building, old and time-worn, guarded by a sentinel?&mdash;it is
the fort to protect the water-gate through which we are now
passing.&nbsp; It is also <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>occasionally used as a prison.&nbsp;
On the opposite side is a poor, dilapidated, wooden building,
erected on a barge, where permits are obtained for spirits and
tobacco&mdash;a diminutive custom-house indeed.&nbsp; There being
no one to question or molest us, we pass on, and in a few moments
are at our landing-place, a short flight of stone steps leading
to the Vorsetzen or quay.</p>
<p>Tom moors his boat with a grave celerity, leads the way up the
stone steps on to the quay, and as speedily disappears down a
sort of trap which gapes in the open street, in the immediate
vicinity of the landing-place.&nbsp; Let him alone; Tom knows the
way.&nbsp; We follow him down an almost perpendicular flight of
stairs into a spirit kellar, and gratify Tom&rsquo;s little
propensity for ardent liquors.</p>
<p>Tom has disappeared, and is now paddling his way back to the
&ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; and we stand upon the humble water-terrace,
the Vorsetzen, looking out upon the shipping.&nbsp; It is a
still, bright, Sunday afternoon in September.&nbsp; There is no
broiling sun to weary us; the sky is clear, and the air soft and
cheering, like the breath of a spring morning.&nbsp; We will turn
our backs upon the river and proceed up Neuerweg.</p>
<p>We cannot walk upon the narrow strip of footpath, for, besides
that there is very little of it, our course would become a sort
of serpentine as we wound about the fresh young trees which skirt
the edge of it at regular intervals.&nbsp; But are they not
pleasant to look upon, those leafy sentinels, standing by the
stone steps of the houses, shaking their green tops in happy
contrast to the whitened walls?&nbsp; So we will walk in the
road, and being good-tempered today, will not indulge in violent
invectives upon the round-topped little pebbles which form the
pavement; but, should we by chance step into a puddle which has
no manner of means of running out of our way, we will look with
complacency at our dirtied boots, and trip smilingly on.&nbsp;
Yes, trip is the word, for I defy the solemnest pedestrian in
Christendom to keep a measured pace upon these upright, pointed,
shining-faced pebbles.</p>
<p>There! we are in the Schaar-markt.&nbsp; Now look around, and
say, would you not fancy yourself in some quaint old English
village?&nbsp; What a curious complication of cross-beams is
presented in the fronts of the houses!&mdash;a barring and
binding of huge timbers, with their angles filled in with red
bricks.&nbsp; How simple and neat is everything!&mdash;the clean
stone steps leading up to the principal entrance of each house,
and the humbler flight which conducts you to the <i>kellar</i>
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>and kitchen.&nbsp; You would imagine you had seen the
place before, or dreamt of it, or read of it in some glorious old
book when your memory was fresh and young.</p>
<p>See that young damsel with bare arms, no bonnet, no cap, but
her hair cleanly and neatly parted in the middle of her head, and
disclosing her round, rosy, honest German face.&nbsp; She is not
pretty, but how innocent and good-tempered she looks; and see how
lightly and easily she springs over those, to us, ruthless
pebbles, her short petticoats showing her clean white stockings
and bright shoes to advantage.</p>
<p>And here comes a male native of the place; a shortish,
square-built, and somewhat portly man, clad in a comfortable,
old-fashioned way, with nothing dashing or expensive about
him.&nbsp; He is not very brisk, to be sure; and when you first
look at his round face an idea of his simplicity comes over you;
but it is only for an instant, and then you read the solid,
sterling qualities quietly shining in his clear eyes.&nbsp; There
is not a great amount of intellectuality, that is to say nervous
intellectuality, in his contented countenance, but a vast
quantity of unstudied common sense.</p>
<p>We will pass on, leaving the guard-house on our left; and
winding up Hohleweg, many simple and not a few pretty faces with
roguish eyes do we see at the open windows.</p>
<p>We halt only for a moment to look at the noble Michaelis
Kirche which lies to our right, and turn off on the left hand,
crossing an open space of some extent called Zeughaus Platz, and
behold us before the Altonaer Thor, or Altona-gate.</p>
<p>Ah, these are pleasant banks and noble trees!&nbsp; How green
the grass upon those slopes&mdash;how fresh the flowers!&nbsp;
And what a splendid walk is this, looking to the right down the
double avenue of sturdy stems waving their spreading tops across
the path!&nbsp; You did not think that quaint old town below
could boast of such a border as this; but take a tour about the
environs, and you will find them cheerful, fresh, and beautiful,
from Neuer Kaye to Deich Thor.</p>
<p>We will pass through the simple Altona-gate, and make towards
Hamburger-Berg.&nbsp; Do not be alarmed.&nbsp; Perhaps you have
heard of the &ldquo;Berg&rdquo; before, and virtuous people have
told you that it is a godless place.&nbsp; Well, so it is; but we
will steer clear of its godlessness; we will avoid the
dancing-houses.&nbsp; Before us lies a broad open road, neither
dignified by buildings nor ornamented by trees, <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>but there are
plenty of people, and they are worth our notice.&nbsp; There is a
neat figure in a close boddice and a hauben, or hood-like
headdress; she has taken to winter attire early.&nbsp; She
carries no trailing skirts, nor has she ill-shapen ankles to
hide.&nbsp; Look at her healthy face, though the cheek-bones are
rather too high; but the mouth is ever breaking into a
smile.&nbsp; Her hair is drawn back tightly from her face, tied
in a knot at the back, and covered with a velvet skull-cap,
richly worked with gold and silver wire and braid.&nbsp; The
effect is not bad.</p>
<p>There is a country girl from Bardewick&mdash;Bardewick, you
know, though now a mere village, is traditionally said to have
been once a large and flourishing city.&nbsp; She has flowers to
sell, and stands by the wayside.&nbsp; She has neither shoes nor
stockings, nor is her dark dress and white apron of the
longest.&nbsp; Her tightly fitting boddice is of blue cloth, with
bullet buttons, and has but a short waist, while a coral confines
her apron and dress.&nbsp; Her head-dress is only a striped
coloured handkerchief, tied under the chin, but in such a way
that it presents a sort of straight festoon just above her
sparkling eyes, and completely hides her hair.</p>
<p>But here comes a curiosity of the male species.&nbsp; Surely
this is Rip van Winkle from the States.&nbsp; He has no
sugar-loaf hat, but he wears the trunkhose, stockings, and large
buckled shoes of the old Dutchman, and even his ample jacket,
with an enormous sort of frill at the bottom.&nbsp; No, my
friend, let me give you to understand that this is a
<i>Vierl&auml;nder</i>, and a farmer of some means.&nbsp; Do you
not see that he has a double row of bullet buttons on his jacket,
down the front of his ample hose, and even along the edges of his
enormous pockets?&nbsp; They are solid silver, every button of
them, nor are the massive buckles on his shoes of any more gross
material.&nbsp; Here come more velvet skull-caps, with gold and
silver worked into them.&nbsp; How jauntily the wearers trip
along!&nbsp; It is a fact, the abominable pavement of Hamburg
sets the inhabitants eternally on their toes.</p>
<p>Here is a Tyroler, and a tall fellow he is; straight as an
arrow, and nimble as a chamois; but yet with a steady, earnest
look about him, although a secret smile is playing round his
handsome, mustachioed mouth, that tells you of a strong and
persevering character.&nbsp; He is shaped like an Adonis, and his
short jacket, breeches, pale striped stockings, and tightly laced
boots; the broad leathern embroidered band about his waist, and
the steeple-crowned hat with the little coquettish feather, all
help to make up a figure that you <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>would like to
see among his native mountains.&nbsp; And yet he is but a
dignified sort of pedlar, and would be very happy to sell you a
dozen or so of table napkins, Alpine handkerchiefs, or a few
pieces of tape.</p>
<p>Well! he is gone, and before us comes a female figure, who
forms a fit companion to the silver-buttoned
<i>Vierl&auml;nder</i> we have just past.&nbsp; Notice her dress;
she is a <i>Vierl&auml;nderin</i>.&nbsp; Her petticoats are
shamefully short, you will say, stiff and plaited too as they
are, but what a gallant pair of red stockings she wears, and what
a neat, bright pair of buckled shoes!&nbsp; Her dress consists of
a close boddice with long sleeves, all of dark purple stuff, and
her neat black apron does not make a bad contrast to it.&nbsp;
But her head-gear!&mdash;her hair is drawn from her face under a
closely fitting caul, while an exaggerated black bow, or rather a
pair of triangular wings, project some distance from the back of
the head, and beneath them two enormous tails of hair trail down
her back, each terminating in a huge red bow.</p>
<p>This country girl appears to have sold all her fruit, and has
placed her basket upside down upon her head.&nbsp; No such thing;
that is her peculiar head-dress; look again, and you will see
that it is a small plaited straw basket, about a foot and a half
in diameter, with a very deep straight edge.&nbsp; It is fastened
on her head by a caul sewn into the inside.&nbsp; Well! at any
rate this is a Quakeress we see coming at such a stately pace
along the gravelled road?&nbsp; Wrong again, my friend; this is a
young lady from Heligoland, the little island we passed at the
mouth of the Elbe, and a very prim and neat young lady she is,
though where she got her bonnet shape from I cannot say.</p>
<p>The way is lined with hawkers of every description: fruit,
songs and sausages; toys, sticks and cigars; pipes, sweetmeats
and tape; every imaginable article that was ever sold at a fair
is to be found here, and every vender in a different dress,
illustrating at one view the peasant costumes of every village in
the vicinity.&nbsp; As for tobacco, the air is like a gust from
some gigantic pipe.&nbsp; Here is the entrance to
Franconi&rsquo;s Circus, though not yet open for public
entertainment.&nbsp; Blasts of obstreperous music rush upon you
from every door; the shrill squealing of a flageolet being heard
above everything else.</p>
<p>Knife-swallowers, mesmerisers, and the eternal
Punch&mdash;here called Caspar&mdash;ballad-singers, tumblers,
quacks, and incredible <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>animals, are here for
inspection.&nbsp; You would fancy it was some old English fair;
for in spite of yourself there is a quaint feeling steals over
you, that you had suddenly tumbled back into the middle of the
last century.</p>
<p>And who pays for all this? for whose especial amusement is all
this got up?&nbsp; For our old friend &ldquo;Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here are English sailors, and French sailors; sailors in green
velveteen jackets; sailors with their beards and whiskers curled
into little shining ringlets.&nbsp; We meet our salt-water friend
everywhere, and, by the intense delight depicted on his features,
&ldquo;Jack&rdquo; is evidently in a high state of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Let us go on; we have promised not to visit the dancehouses
to-day, and we will quit this clamorous crowd.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
ALTONA.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">the poet&rsquo;s
grave</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">a danish harvest
home</span>.</p>
<p>We tread upon elevated ground, and far away to our left, down
in a hollow, flows the broad Elbe; placid indeed from this
distance, for not a ripple can we see upon its surface.&nbsp; A
few ships are lazily moving on its waters.&nbsp; Stand aside, and
make way for this reverend gentleman; he is a <i>prediger</i>, a
preacher of the gospel; he is habited in a black gown, black silk
stockings and shoes, a small black velvet skull-cap on his head,
while round his neck bristles a double plaited frill, white as a
curd, and stiff as block tin.&nbsp; You would take him for the
Dutch nobleman in an old panel painting.&nbsp; It may appear
rather grotesque to your unaccustomed eyes, but remember there
are many things very ridiculous at home.</p>
<p>A blackened gate, a confused mass of houses, an open square,
and the pebbles again, and we are in Holstein, Denmark, in the
public square and market place of Altona.&nbsp; Here it is that
the Danish state lotteries are drawn, and we might moralise upon
that subject, but that we prefer to press onwards to the real
village of Altona.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Here through this beautiful avenue of trees; here where
the sunshine is broken into patches by the waving foliage; far
away from the din of trumpets, huxterers and showmen; here can
the sweet air whisper its low song of peace and lull our fervid
imaginations into tranquillity.&nbsp; This is no solitude, though
all is quiet and in repose.&nbsp; Under the trees and in the road
are throngs of loiterers, but there is no rude laughter, no
coarse jests; a moving crowd is there, but a quiet and happy
one.&nbsp; And now we come upon the venerable church with its low
steeple, its time-eaten stone walls, and its humble, grassy,
flower-spangled graves.&nbsp; We see a passer-by calling the
attention of his friend to a stone tablet, green and worn with
age, and surrounded by a slight railing.&nbsp; Can it be that
there is a spirit hovering over that grave whose influence is
peace and love?&nbsp; May not some mighty man lie buried there,
the once frail tenement of a great mind whose noble thoughts have
years ago wakened a besotted world to truths and aspirations
hitherto unknown?&nbsp; There is veneration and respect in every
countenance that gazes upon that simple stone; a solemn tread in
every foot that trenches on its limits.&nbsp; This is the grave
of a great poet.&nbsp; A man whose works, though little read in
modern times, were once the wonder of his country; and whose very
name comes upon the German people in a gush of melody, and a halo
of bright thoughts.&nbsp; It is like an old legend breathed
through the chords of a harp.&nbsp; This is the grave of
Klopstock, the Milton of Germany.&nbsp; We will enter the
churchyard, and look for a moment on the unimposing tablet.&nbsp;
The inscription is scarcely legible, but the poet&rsquo;s mother
lies also buried here, and some others of his family.&nbsp; Could
there be anything more humble, more unobtrusive?&nbsp; No; but
there is something about the grave of a great poet that serves to
dignify the simplest monument, and shed a lustre round the lowest
mound.</p>
<p>We will cross the churchyard to yonder low brick wall which
confines it.&nbsp; There are clusters of rosy, happy children,
clambering about its crumbling top; little knots of men too in
the road beyond&mdash;evidently expecting something.&nbsp; Even
this is in keeping with the poet&rsquo;s grave, which should not
be sombre and melancholy, like other graves; and what could
better embellish and enliven its aspect than young, blushing life
clustering around it?&nbsp; We linger awhile among the boisterous
children playing on the churchyard wall, and then we hear a
confused sound of voices and music in the distance.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;What is this we hear, my friend?&rdquo; we
inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the harvest-home; if you wait you will see the
procession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turn out upon the high road, and soon come upon the first
signs of this Danish festival.&nbsp; An open gravelled space of
some extent stretches out before an imposing mansion of modern
appearance; a plantation of trees on each side shapes the space
into a rude semicircle.&nbsp; This mansion is the manor house,
and in front, in the midst of a confused crowd, some dozen young
men in gay sylvan costumes are standing in a circle, armed with
flails, and vigorously threshing the ground.&nbsp; Jolly, hearty
young fellows they are, and a merry chant they raise.&nbsp; One
eager thresher in his zeal breaks his flail at the bend, and a
shout from the bystanders greets the exploit.</p>
<p>Now they thresh their way from the great house to a hostelry
where the remaining portion of the pageant is awaiting their
arrival.&nbsp; Let us stand a little on one side and view the
procession.&nbsp; The threshers lead the way, singing and plying
their flails as they advance, thus effectually clearing the road
for the rest.&nbsp; A merry group of other threshers, each with
his lass upon his arm, and his flail swung across his shoulder,
come tripping after, singing the harvest song and dancing to
their own music.&nbsp; Now a rude wooden car comes lumbering on,
and within sits a grave man in old German costume, who from a
large sack before him takes handsful of grain, and liberally
casts it about him.&nbsp; This is the sower, but the grain is in
this instance only chaff.&nbsp; Now follow heavy instruments of
husbandry&mdash;ploughs and harrows&mdash;while rakes, scythes,
and reaping-hooks form a picturesque trophy behind them.&nbsp; A
shout of laughter greets the next figure in the procession, for
it is no other than the jolly god Bacchus.&nbsp; And a hearty,
rubicund, big-bellied god he is, and very decent, too, being
decorously clad in a brown suit turned up with red, and cut in
the fashion of the time of Maximilian I., or thereabouts.&nbsp; A
perpetual smile mantles over his broad face, and complacently he
pats his huge rotundity of stomach as he rolls from side to side
on the barrel astride which he is seated.&nbsp; Is he drunk, or
does he only feign?&nbsp; If it be a piece of acting it is
decidedly the most natural we ever saw.</p>
<p>Next comes the miller; a lank rascal, with a white frock, a
tall, white tasselled nightcap, and a cadaverous,
flour-besprinkled face; and he is the reaper, too, it would seem
by the scythe he bears in his hand: other threshers close the
procession.&nbsp; A happy train it is.&nbsp; God speed them
all!&nbsp; A merry time, and many a bounteous harvest!</p>

the antique church, the reverenced grave; and with a soothed and
grateful mind, we will bend our way back to Hamburg, and diving
into one of the odorous cellars on the Jungfern Stieg, will
delectate ourselves with beefsteaks and fried potatoes, our glass
of Baierisches Bier, and perhaps a tiny schnapschen to settle our
repast.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span
class="smcap">magnificence</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">at
church</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">the last
headsman</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herrlichkeit!&rdquo;&nbsp; Magnificence!&nbsp; What a
name!&nbsp; Ye Paradise-rows, ye Mount-pleasants, what is your
pride of appellation to this?&nbsp; In all Belgravia there is not
a terrace, place, or square that can match it.&nbsp; Fancy the
question, &ldquo;Where do you reside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Magnificence&mdash;number forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet it is a fact, Magnificence is a street in Hamburg.&nbsp; I
have lived in Magnificence.</p>
<p>The Herrlichkeit, like many other places of imposing title,
loses considerably upon a close acquaintance.&nbsp; You approach
it from the waterside through a rugged way, blessed with the
euphonious appellation of Stuben Huck; and having climbed over
two pebbly bridges&mdash;looking down as you do so at the busy
scene in the docks below, where crowds of canal craft lie packed
and jumbled together&mdash;you turn a little to the left hand and
behold&mdash;Magnificence!</p>
<p>Magnificence has no footpath, but it is not singular in that
respect.&nbsp; It is of rather less than the average width of the
streets in Hamburg&mdash;and they are all narrow&mdash;and the
houses are lofty.&nbsp; It is paved with small pebbles, and has a
gutter running down the centre; and as a short flight of stone
steps forms the approach to the chief entrance of each house, the
available roadway is small indeed.&nbsp; But they are grand
houses in Magnificence, at least they have been, and still bear
visible signs of their former character.</p>
<p>Let us enter one house; it will serve as a type of many houses
in Hamburg.&nbsp; Having mounted the stone steps, we stand before
a half-glazed folding-door, and seeing a small brass lever before
us, <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>we test its power, and find the door yield to the
pressure.&nbsp; But we have set a clamorous bell ringing, like
that of a suburban huxter, for this is the Hamburger&rsquo;s
substitute for a knocker.&nbsp; We enter a large stone-paved
hall, lighted from the back, where a glazed balcony overlooks the
teeming canal.&nbsp; You wish to wipe your shoes.&nbsp; Well! do
you see this pattern of a small area-railing cut in wood?&nbsp;
That is our scraper and door-mat&mdash;all in one.</p>
<p>To our right is a massive oaken staircase.&nbsp; We ascend in
gloom, for the staircase being built in the middle of the house,
only a few straggling rays of light can reach it, and whence they
proceed is a mystery.&nbsp; Every few steps we mount we are upon
the point of stumbling into the door of some cupboard or
apartment; they are in all sorts of places.&nbsp; At length we
reach a broad landing paved with stone.&nbsp; What a complication
of doors and passages, which the vague light tends to make more
obscure!&nbsp; Here are huge presses, lumbering oaken cabinets,
jammed into corners.&nbsp; We ascend a second flight and arrive
at another extensive landing.&nbsp; Here are two suites of
apartments, besides odd little cribs in the corners which are not
occupied by other presses.&nbsp; There are still two floors
above, but as they are both contained in the huge gable roof of
the house, they are more useful as store-rooms than as habitable
apartments.&nbsp; The quantity of wood we see about us is
frightful when associated with the idea of fire.</p>
<p>We will enter the suite on the right hand; the apartments are
light and agreeable, and overlook the canal, and, when the tide
is up, and the canal full, and the grassy bleaching ground on the
opposite bank is dotted with white linen, it is a pleasant scene
indeed; but when the tide is out&mdash;ugh! the River Thames at
low water is a paradise to it.&nbsp; The tidal changes are
carefully watched, and it is not an unusual occurrence to hear
the solemn gun booming through the air as a warning to the
inhabitants to block and barricade their cellars and kitchens
against the rush of waters.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is Sunday morning, and the most beautiful melody of bells I
ever heard is toning through the air.&nbsp; They are the bells of
S. Michael&rsquo;s church, and I am told that the musician plays
them by a set of pedal keys, and works himself into a mighty heat
and flurry in the operation.&nbsp; But we cannot think of the
wild manner and mad motions of the player in connection with
those beautiful sounds, so clear and melodious; that half
plaintive music so sweetly measured.&nbsp; <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>They ring
thus every morning, commencing at a quarter to six, and play till
the hour strikes.</p>
<p>We descend, and make our way through irregular streets and
dingy canals till we reach the church of St. Jacobi.&nbsp; It
stands in an open space, is neither railed in, nor has it a
graveyard attached to it.&nbsp; It is of stone, and has an
immense gable roof, slated, and studded with eaved windows.&nbsp;
A shortish square basement is at one end, from which springs a
tall octangular steeple.&nbsp; Within all is quiet and
decorous.&nbsp; The church is paved with stone, and there is a
double row of pews down the centre.&nbsp; But is this a
Protestant Church?&nbsp; Most assuredly; Lutheran.&nbsp; You are
astonished at the crosses, the images, the altar?&nbsp; True!
there is something Romish in the whole arrangement, but it is
Protestant for all that.&nbsp; You cannot help feeling vexed at
the pertinacity with which the Germans whitewash everything, nor
do the pale lavender-coloured curtains of the pulpit appear in
keeping with the edifice.&nbsp; Everything is scrupulously
clean.</p>
<p>We are too late to hear the congregational singing, the
devotional union of voices, for as we enter the minister ascends
into the pulpit in his black velvet skull-cap, and bristling
white frill.&nbsp; Unless you are a good German scholar you will
fail to understand the discourse so earnestly, so emphatically
delivered.&nbsp; The echo of the building, and the high character
of the composition, will baffle and mislead you; while, at the
same time, the incessant tingling of the little silver bells
suspended from the corners of scarlet velvet bags, which are
handed along the pews (at the end of a stick), during the whole
of the sermon, will distract and irritate you.&nbsp; It is thus
they collect alms for the poor.&nbsp; Yet even to one ignorant of
the language, there is a fullness and vigour in the style and
manner of delivery that would almost persuade you that you had
understood, and felt convinced of the truth of what you had
heard.&nbsp; As we quit the church we purchase at the door a
printed copy of the sermon from a poor widow woman, who is there
to sell them at a penny each.</p>
<p>We will loiter home to dinner.&nbsp; The streets are thronged
with people, with cheerful, contented faces, and in holiday
attire.&nbsp; Who are these grave gentlemen?&nbsp; This little
troop in sable trappings; buskins, cloaks, silken hose, hats and
feathers, and shoes with large rosettes&mdash;all black and
sombre, like so many middle aged Hamlets?&nbsp; Can they be
masqueraders on the Sabbath?&nbsp; Possibly some of the senators
in their official costume?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Oh, human
vanity!&nbsp; A <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>passer-by informs us that they are
only undertakers&rsquo; men&mdash;paid mourners.&nbsp; They are
to swell the funeral procession, and are the mere mimics of
woe.&nbsp; The undertakers of Hamburg vie with each other in the
dressing of their men, and indeed, one indispensable part of
their &ldquo;stock-in-trade&rdquo; are some half-dozen
dress-suits of black, it matters not of what age or country, the
stranger the better, so that the &ldquo;effect&rdquo; be
good.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We will take a stroll about the beautiful Alster this Sunday
afternoon.&nbsp; It is late autumn, and the early budding trees
have already shed their leaves.&nbsp; But rich, floating masses
of foliage are still there&mdash;the deepening hues of autumn,
and here and there broad patches of bright summer green.&nbsp;
There are two Alsters, the &ldquo;inner&rdquo; and
&ldquo;outer,&rdquo; each of them a broad expanse of water; they
are connected by flood-gates, surrounded by verdure, and studded
with pleasure-boats; while on the city side several elegant
pavilions hang on the water&rsquo;s edge, where coffee and
beverages of every kind can be obtained, and the seldom omitted
and never-to-be-forgotten music of the Germans may be heard
thrilling in the evening air.</p>
<p>It is already growing dusk; let us enter the <i>Alster
Halle</i>.&nbsp; This is the most important of these
pavilions.&nbsp; It is not large; there is but the
ground-floor.&nbsp; It has much the appearance of a French
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, the whole space being filled with small,
round, white marble tables, and innumerable chairs.&nbsp; Here
all the lighter articles of refreshment are to be obtained; tea,
coffee, wines, spirits and pastry in numberless shapes.&nbsp;
There is an inner room where the more quietly disposed can read
his newspaper in comparative silence; here are German, Danish,
French, and English journals, and a little sprinkling of literary
periodicals.&nbsp; Another room is set apart for billiards, where
silent, absorbed individuals may be seen playing eternally at
poule.&nbsp; In the evening a little band of skilled musicians,
in the pay of the proprietor, perform choice morsels of beautiful
music, and all this can be enjoyed for the price of a cup of
coffee&mdash;twopence!</p>
<h3>THE LAST HEADSMAN.</h3>
<p>Ten years ago the ancient city of Hamburg was awakened into
terror by the commission of a fearful murder.&nbsp; The cry of
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; arose in the night; the
<i>nachtw&auml;chter</i> (watchman) gave the alarm; <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and
the few means at command were resorted to with an energy and
goodwill that sufficed soon to extinguish the flames.&nbsp; It
was, however, discovered that the fire had not done the work it
had been kindled for; it would not hide murder.&nbsp; Among the
smouldering embers in the <i>kellar</i> or underground kitchen,
where the fire had originated, was discovered the charred body of
a poor old woman, whose recent wounds were too certain evidences
of a violent death.&nbsp; It was also ascertained that a petty
robbery of some few dollars had been committed, and the utmost
vigilance was called into exercise to discover the
perpetrator.</p>
<p>All surmises were in vain, till suspicion fell upon the
watchman who had first given the alarm; and the first evidence of
the track of guilt being thus fallen upon, it was not difficult
to trace it to its source.&nbsp; Numerous little scraps of
evidence came out, one upon another, till the whole diabolical
plot was stripped of its mystery, and the guilt of the
<i>w&auml;chter</i> clearly proved.&nbsp; He was convicted of the
crime imputed to him, and condemned to death by the Senate.&nbsp;
But on receiving sentence, the condemned man assumed a tone
totally unexpected of him, for he boldly asserted that the
punishment of death had fallen into disuse; that it was no longer
the law of Hamburg; and concluded by defying the Senators to
carry the sentence pronounced into execution.</p>
<p>It was indeed true that the ponderous weapon of the headsman
had lain for two-and-twenty years rusting in its scabbard; nor
without reason.&nbsp; At that period a criminal stood convicted
and condemned to death.&nbsp; The law gave little mercy in those
days, and there was no hesitation in carrying the sentence into
effect.&nbsp; But an unexpected difficulty arose; the old
headsman was but lately dead, and his son, a fine stalwart young
man, was, from inexperience, considered unequal to the
task.&nbsp; A crowd of eager competitors proffered their services
in this emergency, but the ancient city of Hamburg, like some
other ancient cities, was hampered with antiquated usages.&nbsp;
Its profits and other advantages were tied up into little knots
of monopoly, in various shapes of privileges and hereditary
rights.&nbsp; The young headsman claimed his office on the latter
ground; to the surprise of all, his mother, the wife of the old
headsman, not merely supported him in his claim, but persisted,
with a spirit that might have become a Roman matron but certainly
no one else, that if her son were incapable, she herself was
responsible for the performance of her husband&rsquo;s duty, and
would <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>execute it.&nbsp; The Senate was in
consternation, for this assertion of hereditary right was
unanswerable; and while they courteously declined the offer of
the chivalrous mother, they felt constrained to accept the
services of her son.</p>
<p>The fatal morning came; the scaffold stood erected; and
pressing closely around the wooden barriers, stood the anxious
crowd awaiting the execution.&nbsp; The culprit knelt with head
erect, his neck and shoulders bared for the stroke, while the
young headsman stood by his side armed with the double-handed
sword, the weapon of his office.&nbsp; At a sign given, he swung
the tremendous blade in the air, and aimed a fearful blow at the
neck of the condemned; but his skilless hand sloped the broad
blade as it fell, and it struck deeply into the victim&rsquo;s
breast.&nbsp; Amid a cry of terror he raised his sword again;
again it whirled through the air, and again it failed to do its
deadly work.&nbsp; The miserable wretch still lived; and a third
stroke was necessary to complete the task so dreadfully
began.&nbsp; Who can wonder that that fearful weapon had for
years long rested from its service?</p>
<p>Influenced by this terrible scene, and, let us hope, as well
by motives of humanity as by the conviction of the utter
uselessness of such a spectacle as a moral lesson, the Senate of
Hamburg had commuted the punishment of death into that of a life
imprisonment.&nbsp; Yet now they were taunted with their
unreadiness to shed blood, and dared to carry the law, as it
still stood upon the statute-book, into effect.&nbsp; For a while
it seemed that anger would govern the acts of the Senate, for
every preparation was made for the execution.&nbsp; The headsman,
whose blundering essay has been above related, was still living,
but he had long filled the humble office of a messenger, and made
no claim to repeat his effort.&nbsp; Among the many competitors
who offered their services, a Dane was finally selected, and the
inhabitants of Hamburg, excited to the utmost degree by the
anticipation of the forthcoming spectacle, awaited the event with
a morbid and gloating curiosity.&nbsp; They were, however,
disappointed; humanity prevailed, and the guilty
<i>w&auml;chter</i> was conducted to a life prison.</p>
<p>The Senate of Hamburg has not formally abolished the
punishment of death; but the last <i>hereditary</i> headsman is
now growing an old man, and the first and only stroke of his
weapon was dealt thirty-two years ago.</p>

15</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">workmen in
hamburg</span>.</p>
<p>Here amid the implements of labor, in the dingy
<i>werkstube</i> in Johannis Strasse; lighted by the single
flicker of an oil lamp, with the workboard for a writing-desk,
let me endeavour to collect some few scattered details about the
German workmen in Hamburg.</p>
<p>German workmen! do not the very words recall to your memory
old amber-coloured engravings of sturdy men, with waving locks,
grasping the arm of the printing-press, by the side of Faust,
Sch&oelig;ffer, and Gottenberg?&nbsp; Or, perhaps, the words of
Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of the Bell&rdquo; may not be
unknown to you, and hum in your ears:</p>
<p class="poetry">Frisch, gesellen, seyd zur hand!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Von der stirne heiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rinnen muss der schweiss.</p>
<p class="poetry">Briskly, comrades to your work!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the flushing brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must the sweatdrops flow.</p>
<p>But your modern German workman is somewhat of a different
stamp; he points his moustaches with black wax, trims his locks
<i>&agrave; la Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, and wears wide
pantaloons.&nbsp; He tapers his waist with a leathern strap, and
wears a blouse while at his labors.&nbsp; He discards old forms
and regulations as far as he can or dare, and thus the old word
&ldquo;Meister&rdquo; has fallen into disrepute, and the titles
&ldquo;Herr&rdquo; and &ldquo;Principal&rdquo; occupy its
place.&nbsp; Schiller, like a true poet, calls his workmen
&ldquo;gesellen,&rdquo; which is the old German word meaning
companion or comrade, but modern politeness has changed it into
&ldquo;geh&uuml;lfe,&rdquo; assistant; and
&ldquo;mitglied,&rdquo; member.&nbsp; In some places, however,
the words &ldquo;knecht&rdquo; and &ldquo;knappe,&rdquo; servant
or attendant, are still in use to signify journeyman; as
&ldquo;schusterknecht,&rdquo; shoemaker;
&ldquo;schl&auml;chterknecht,&rdquo; butcher&rsquo;s man;
&ldquo;muhlknappe,&rdquo; miller; &ldquo;bergknappe,&rdquo;
miner; <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>but these terms are employed more
from habit than from any invidious distinction.</p>
<p>Well! we live and work on the fourth floor of a narrow slip of
a house in Johannis Strasse.&nbsp; Herr Sorgenpfennig, our
&ldquo;principal,&rdquo; occupies the suite of four rooms, and
devotes a central one (to which no light can possibly come save
at second hand through the door), to his
&ldquo;gesellen.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are three; a quiet Dane, full of
sage precepts, and practical illustrations of economy; a
roystering Bavarian from Nuremberg, who never fails to grieve
over the thin beer of Hamburg, and who, as member of a choral
union near Das Johanneum, delights in vigorous and unexpected
bursts of song; and myself.</p>
<p>Workmen in Hamburg are still in a state of villanage; beneath
the roof of the &ldquo;Herr&rdquo; do they find at once a
workshop, a dormitory, and a home.&nbsp; We endeavour so far to
conform to the rules of propriety as to escape the imprisonment
and other penalties that await the &ldquo;unruly
journeyman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The table of Herr Sorgenpfennig is our
own, and a very liberal one it is esteemed to be.&nbsp; Let me
sketch you a few of its items: delicious coffee, &ldquo;white
bread and brown,&rdquo; or rather black, and unlimited butter,
make up our breakfast.&nbsp; Dinner always commences with a soup,
usually made from meat, sometimes from herbs, lemon, sweet fruit,
or other ingredients utterly indescribable.&nbsp; Meat, to be fit
for a German table, must be carefully pared of every vestige of
fat; if boiled it is underdone, unless expressly devoted to the
soup, when the juiceless shreds that remain are served up with
plums or prepared vegetables; if it be baked (roasting is almost
unknown) it is dry and tasteless.&nbsp; Bacon and sausages, with
their inevitable accompaniment, sourkraut, is a favourite dish;
but not so unvaryingly so as some choose to imagine.&nbsp; Acids
generally are much admired in German cookery.&nbsp; In nothing,
perhaps, are the Hamburgers more to be envied, in a gastronomic
view, than in their vegetables.&nbsp; Singularly small as are
these products of the kitchen garden, they are sweeter and more
delicately flavoured than any I ever tasted elsewhere.&nbsp; As
<i>entremets</i>, and as accompaniments to meat, they are largely
consumed.&nbsp; The Hamburgers laugh at the English cooks who
boil green peas and potatoes in plain water, for here boiled
potatoes are scarcely known&mdash;that nutritious vegetable being
cut into slices and fried; while green peas are slowly stewed in
butter or cream, and sweetened with fine sugar.&nbsp; But we
&ldquo;gesellen&rdquo; have plebeian appetites, and whatever dish
may <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>be set before us, as surely vanishes to its latest
shred.&nbsp; The little patches of puff-paste, smeared with
preserve, sent to us as Sunday treat, or the curious production
in imitation of our English pie, and filled with maccaroni, are
immolated at once without misgiving or remorse.&nbsp; If we sup
at all, it is upon pasty, German cheese, full of holes, as if it
had been made in water, or a hot liver sausage, as an
extraordinary indulgence.</p>
<p>And our &ldquo;Licht Braten?&rdquo;&nbsp; Herr Sorgenpfennig
rubs his short, fat hands, and his round eyes twinkle again, as
he tells his little cluster of &ldquo;Herren Gesellen&rdquo; that
there will be a feast, a sumptuous <i>abendbrod</i>, to
inaugurate the commencement of candle-light.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Licht Braten,&rdquo; as this entertainment is called, is
one of the old customs of Hamburg now falling into disuse.&nbsp;
It would be doing Herr Sorgenpfennig an eternal injustice did we
pass over it in silence, more especially as he boasts of it as
real &ldquo;North German fare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we have it: raw
herrings to begin with.&nbsp; Bah! I confess this does not sound
well upon the first blush; but, then, a raw dried herring is
somewhat different to one salted in a barrel.&nbsp; To cook it
would be a sacrilege, say the Germans.&nbsp; And then the
accompaniments!&nbsp; We have two dishes of wonderful little
potatoes, baked in an oven, freshly peeled and shining; and in
the centre of the table is a bowl of melted butter and mustard
well mixed together.&nbsp; You dip your potato in the butter, and
while you thus soften the deep-sea saltness of your herring, the
rough flavour of the latter relishes and overcomes the unctuous
dressing of your potato.&nbsp; I swear to you it is
delicious!</p>
<p>But where is our &ldquo;braten,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;roast,&rdquo; in fact?&nbsp; Oh, thou unhappy Peter!&nbsp;
I see thee still, reeking over the glowing forge fire, cooking
savoury sausages thou art forbidden to taste!&nbsp; I see thee
still, struggling in vain to &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; the blazing
morsel, rashly plucked (in the momentary absence of
Sorgenpfennig), from the bubbling, hissing fat, and thrust into
thy jaws.&nbsp; Those burning tears! those mad distortions of
limb and feature!&nbsp; God pity thee, Peter, but it was not to
be!&nbsp; Those savoury sausages are our &ldquo;braten,&rdquo;
and they smack wonderfully after the herrings.&nbsp; If there is
one item in our repast to be deplored, it is the Hamburger beer,
which, however, is as good as it can be, I suppose, for the
money&mdash;something under an English penny a bottle.&nbsp; But
here is wine; good, sound wine, not indeed from the Rhine, nor
the Moselle, but red, sparkling, French <i>vin ordinaire</i>, at
a mark&mdash;fourteen-pence the bottle.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Truly, Hamburg, thou art a painstaking, industrious,
money-making city, with more available wealth among thy pitch and
slime than other towns can boast of in their trimness and finery,
but spendthrift, and debauched, and dissolute withal art
thou!</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Punch, du edler trank der Britten</i>!<br />
Punch, thou noble drink of Britons&mdash;</p>
<p>the outburst of some exhilarated poet&mdash;should be
inscribed upon thy double-turreted gate, good Hamburg!&nbsp; The
odorous steam of rum and lemon contends in thine open streets
with the fumes of tobacco; the union of these two perfumes make
up thine atmosphere; while thy public walks are strewn with the
unsmoked ends of cigars, thick as the shrivelled leaves in
autumn.</p>
<p>Seriously, the Hamburger toils earnestly, and takes his
pleasure with a proportionate amount of zeal.&nbsp; His
enjoyments, like his labours, are of a strong and solid
description.&nbsp; The workmen trundle <i>kegle</i> balls in
long, wooden-built alleys; and down in deep beer cellars, snug
and warm, do they cluster, fondling their pipes like favoured
children; taking long gulps of well-made punch, or deeper
draughts of Bairisches beer.&nbsp; If they talk, they do so
vehemently, but they love better to sit and listen to some little
troop of <i>harfenisten</i>&mdash;street harp-players&mdash;as
they tone the waltzes of Lanner, or sing some chivalrous
romance.&nbsp; Sometimes they form themselves into bands of
choristers, and sing with open windows into the street, or play
at billiards as if it were for life, or congregate in the
dance-houses, and waltz by the hour without a pause.&nbsp; In all
they are hearty, somewhat boisterous, but never wanting in good
temper.</p>
<p>As marriage is out of the question with the workman in
Hamburg, whether stranger or native&mdash;unless indeed the
latter may have passed through the probationary course of travel
and conscription, and be already on the verge of
mastership&mdash;so also is honourable courtship.&nbsp; His low
wages and dependent position form an impassable barrier to
wedlock, and a married journeyman is almost unknown.&nbsp; By the
law of his native city he must travel for two or three years,
independently of the chances of conscription, and thus for a
period at least he becomes a restless wanderer, without tie or
home.&nbsp; No prudent maiden can listen to his addresses, and
thus it is that Hamburg swarms with unfortunates; and this it is
which gives them rights and immunities unknown in any other
city.</p>

<p>It is Sunday again.&nbsp; Soberly and sedately do we pass our
morning hours.&nbsp; We waken with the sweet music of bells in
our ears; bells that whisper to us of devotion; bells that thrill
us with a calm delight, and raise up in us thoughts of gentleness
and charity.</p>
<p>There is no lack of churches; we see their tapering steeples
and deep gable roofs rising above the general level in many
places, and there is a Little Bethel down by the water&rsquo;s
side on the Vorsetzen, for the sailors.&nbsp; There are two or
three Little Pandemoniums in its immediate vicinity, or at least
by that classical title are they designated by the Bethlemites
over the way; but salt-water Jack and fresh-river Jack give them
much simpler names, and like them a great deal better,
more&rsquo;s the pity.&nbsp; We have heard the little jangling
bells in the church pews, and they will not ring in tune,
although they tell the deeds of charity; we have marched staidly
home, and joined in Herr Sorgenpfennig&rsquo;s blessing over the
midday meal;&mdash;Herr Sorgenpfennig delivers it with the
presence and intonation of an Eastern patriarch, standing among
his tribe;&mdash;and the delicacies of German cookery having
fulfilled their purpose and disappeared, with a whispered grace
and a bow of humbleness, we sidle out of the room, and leave the
&ldquo;Herr Meister&rdquo; to his meditations and his
punch.&nbsp; And so ends the service of the day.</p>
<p>The blond-headed Bavarian begins to hum the last
<i>Tafelli&ecirc;d</i>, and our quiet Dane smiles
reservedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whither, friends, shall we bend our
steps?&rdquo;&nbsp; No! by the eternal spirit of modesty, we will
not visit the dance-houses to-day!&nbsp; Those vile shambles by
the water-side, growing out of the slime and filth of the river,
and creeping like a noxious, unwholesome weed, up the shaded
hill, and by narrow ruts and gullies into the open country.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; Those half-draped, yet gaping doors, have no
attractions for us; those whining notes of soulless music find no
echo in our ears or hearts.&nbsp; There, in their hideous
blandishments, the shameless sit, miserable in their <!-- page
20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>tawdriness, their painted cheeks peeling in the hot sun,
which they cannot shut out if they would.&nbsp; Throughout the
long day the wearied minstrels pant over their greasy tubes of
brass, or scrape their grimy instruments with horny fingers,
praying for the deep night; and there, through the long day, does
the echoing floor rebound with the beating of vigorous feet; for
salt-water Jack is there, and fresh-river Jack is there, and
while there is a copper <i>pfennig</i> in their pockets, or a
flicker of morality in their hearts, doomed are they equally; for
what can escape spoliation or wreck among such a crowd?</p>
<p>Yet from such commodities as these does the merchant spirit of
the Senate of Hamburg draw huge profits; indeed, it is said that
the whole expense of police and city, and what is worse, yet
better, the tending of the sick, the feeding of the poor, and the
succouring of the helpless and desolate, are alike defrayed from
the produce of the city&rsquo;s vice; and let us add, the
Senate&rsquo;s fostering care of it.</p>
<p>And if we wandered out beyond the walls to the right or to the
left, what do we find?&nbsp; On the one hand, &ldquo;Peter
Hund&rsquo;s;&rdquo; on the other &ldquo;Unkraut&rsquo;s
Pavilion;&rdquo; mere dance-houses, after all, though for
&ldquo;the better sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Peter&rdquo; has a
tawdry hall, smeared with the escutcheons of all nations, where
music and waltzing whirl through the dense air, hour after hour;
and what is at least of equal consequence to him, Peter holds a
tavern in the next room, where spirits, beer, or coffee are
equally at the command of the drouthy or the luxuriant.&nbsp; And
so also if we followed the road which passes through Stein Thor,
away across the leafy fringing of trees and shrubs which ornament
the city&rsquo;s outline; and still on through the shady avenues
of youthful stems, when we come upon a great house with deep
overhanging eaves, square-topped chimneys, and altogether with a
Swiss air about it.&nbsp; There are idlers hanging about the
door, for this is &ldquo;Unkraut&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and the brisk
air of musical instruments streams out of the open portal.&nbsp;
Within all is motion and uproar.&nbsp; A large <i>salle de
danse</i> occupies the greater part of the ground floor, the
central portion of which is appropriated to the waltzers, while a
broad slip on each side, beneath an overhanging gallery, running
round the whole of the apartment, remains for those who drink, or
take a temporary repose.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the flood of
waltzers pours in upon the side-tables, amid the clatter of
chairs, the ringing of glass and china, and the laughter of the
spectators.&nbsp; Gentlemen are not allowed to dance with their
hats on; (where else, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, can they place
them?) and must lay their heavy pipes and cigars aside, as <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>smoking is permitted only in the gallery above.&nbsp;
The company is of the &ldquo;better sort&rdquo; in the
<i>salle</i> below; that is to say, that vice, shameless and
unveiled, is not allowed to flaunt without a check; but there is
taint and gangrene among all; feeble wills and failing hearts to
bear up against the intoxicating stream of music, and giddy heads
for thought or reason amid the whirl and swimming of the
dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unkraut&rsquo;s&rdquo; has, however, attractions apart
from the ball-room.&nbsp; By a quiet stair at the end of the
gallery, through muffled doors that close upon you as you enter,
and shut out like walls the hum and hubbub below, we come upon an
ill-shapen apartment, where hushed, absorbed men are seated at
desks, as at a school, each with a huge frame dotted with numbers
before him.&nbsp; A strange contrast to the scene without.&nbsp;
There is a heavy quiet in the place, disturbed only by an
occasional cough, a shuffling of feet, and the silvery ringing of
little plates of glass.&nbsp; A monstrous game of Lotto is
this.&nbsp; A mere child&rsquo;s play of gambling, requiring
neither tact, wit, nor reasoning; a simple lottery, in fact,
dependent for success upon the accidental marking (each player
upon his own board or table) of the first five numbers that may
be drawn.&nbsp; Now we hear a strange rattling of wooden pieces,
shaken in a bag, and as each piece is drawn, a bustling man with
an obstreperous voice, calls out the number; not in full,
sonorous German, but in broad, uncouth Platt Deutsche (low
German), and eager tongues respond from distant corners claiming
the prize.&nbsp; A dull-headed game is this, fitted only for the
most inveterate gamblers; but it yields money to the Stadt, and
that is its recommendation.</p>
<p>As the day wears on, its attractions increase.&nbsp; The Elb
Pavilion offers a rare treat; exquisite music, executed with
vigour, delicacy, and precision.&nbsp; Moreover, its frequenters
are decidedly of a respectable class.&nbsp; But we will not be
moved; we have set our hearts upon witnessing a play of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, announced for this night at the Stadt
Theatre, and that no less a one than &ldquo;Hamlet, Prince of
Denmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Stadt Theatre in Hamburg enjoys a strange monopoly; for by
the Senate&rsquo;s will it is declared that no other theatre
shall exist within the city walls.&nbsp; Yet, curiously enough, a
wonderful old woman, by some unaccountable freak, has the
privilege, or hereditary right, of licensing or directing a
theatrical establishment within the boundaries, and thus a second
theatre contends for the favours of the public; and in order to
define its position and state of existence, it <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>is entitled
simply Das Zweite Theatre (The Second Theatre).&nbsp; It is an
especially favourite place of amusement with the Hamburgers,
although they play an incomprehensible jumble of unconnected
scenes, called &ldquo;possen,&rdquo; adapted solely to display
the peculiar talents of certain actors.&nbsp; One odd fellow
there reaps showers of applause for no other exhibition of
ability than that of looking intensely stupid, for he seldom
utters a word; but assumes an appearance of unfathomable vacuity
that is inimitable.&nbsp; There are still two theatres outside
the city walls: the one, the Tivoli, devoted to farces and
vaudevilles; the other consecrated to the portrayal of the deeply
sentimental, and the fearfully tragic&mdash;with poison,
dagger-blades, convulsions and heavy-stamping ever at
command.</p>
<p>But our play!&nbsp; Here we are in the gallery of a splendid
edifice, equal in extent to our Covent Garden Theatre at home,
having come to this part of the house in anticipation of a feeble
audience in preference to the parterre or pit.&nbsp; Note also,
that here we pay eight <i>schillinge</i> only, while a place
below would cost us twenty.&nbsp; But the house is crammed, for
Shakespeare draws as well in Germany as in England, perhaps for
the simple reason that in no other country are his works so well
translated.&nbsp; We find ourselves in the midst of a dense
cluster of earnest Danes, who say the most impressive things in
the quietest way in the world.&nbsp; They are strongly interested
in the coming performance, for &ldquo;Hamlet the Dane&rdquo; has
taken deep hold upon the Danish affections; and in Elsinore, so
great is the consideration entertained for this all but fabulous
prince, that they will point you out the garden wherein his royal
father suffered murder</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;most foul, strange, and unnatural,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the grave where the &ldquo;gentle prince&rdquo; himself
lies buried.&nbsp; The play begins; with the deepest earnestness
the audience listen, and, crowded as they are, preserve the
utmost quiet.&nbsp; The glorious drama scene by scene unfolds
itself, and passage by passage we recognise the beauties of our
great poet.&nbsp; Herr Carr, starring it from Vienna, is no
unworthy representative of the noble-hearted Dane, although
unequal, we think, to the finer traits, and more delicate
emotions of the character.&nbsp; The dresses are admirable,
sometimes gorgeous, and the groupings most effective.&nbsp; The
scenery alone is unsatisfactory; indecisive and colourless as it
is, without <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>depth or tone, it strikes you as the
first effort in perspective of a feeble-handed amateur.&nbsp; As
the play proceeds, the action grows upon us, and the rapt
spectators resent with anger the least outcry or
disturbance.&nbsp; The first scene with the players is omitted,
but the concluding portion is a triumph; for as <i>Hamlet</i>,
arriving at the climax of his sarcasm, and bursting for a moment
into rage, flings the flute away, with the exclamation:
&ldquo;S&rsquo;blood, do you think I am easier to be played on
than a pipe?&rdquo; the whole theatre rings with the
applause.</p>
<p>Presently, however, we are aware of a gap, a huge hiatus in
the performance; a grave, and yet no grave, for the whole
churchyard scene, with its quaint and exquisite philosophy, the
rude wit of the gravediggers, and the pointed moralising of the
prince, are all wanting&mdash;all swept away by the ruthless hand
of the critic; skulls and bones, picks and mattocks, wit and
drollery, diggers, waistcoats and all!&nbsp; Not even
<i>Yorick</i>, with his &ldquo;gibes&rdquo; and &ldquo;flashes of
merriment&rdquo;&mdash;not even he is spared.&nbsp; On the other
hand, a portion of a scene is represented which, until lately,
was always omitted on the English stage.&nbsp; It is that in
which the guilty king, overcome by remorse, thus
soliloquises:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Hamlet</i>, coming upon his murderous uncle in his prayers,
exclaims:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Now might I do it, pat, while he is praying;<br />
And now I&rsquo;ll do &rsquo;t&mdash;and so he goes to heaven:<br
/>
And so am I revenged?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The omission or retention of this scene might well be a matter
of dispute, for while it represents the guilty Claudius miserable
and contrite, even in the height of his success, it also portrays
the anticipated revenge of <i>Hamlet</i> in so fearful a light,
that he stands there, not the human instrument of divine
retribution, but with all the diabolical cravings of Satan
himself.&nbsp; I leave this question to abler critics, and, in
the meantime, our play is finished, amid shouts of delight and
calls before the curtain.&nbsp; It is but half-past nine, yet
this is a late hour for a German theatre, where they rarely
perform more than one piece, and that seldom exceeding two hours
in duration.&nbsp; Descending to the street, wrapped in the
recollections of the gorgeous poem whose beauties still echo in
our ears, we are vulgar enough to relish hot sausages and
Bavarian beer.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>An hour later we pace our half-lighted Johannis Strasse,
seeking the portal of our house amid the gloom.&nbsp; Suddenly we
are startled by the tramp of a heavy foot, and the clang and
rattle of a steel weapon as it strikes upon the ground.&nbsp; A
burly voice assails us: &ldquo;Whither are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is this Bernardo, wandered from the ramparts in search of the
ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s father?</p>
<p>Not so: it is but one of the night-watch, armed with an
enormous halbert which might have done good service in the thirty
years&rsquo; war.&nbsp; The faithful <i>nachtw&auml;chter</i>
strikes it upon the ground with the butt-end at regular
intervals, so that sinful depredators may have timely notice of
his approach.&nbsp; As it has a large hook at the back it is said
to be admirably adapted for catching thieves by the leg, if its
opportune clattering does not keep them out of its reach.</p>
<p>We render a good account of ourselves, and are duly escorted
to our home.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">the german
workman</span>.</p>
<p>That workmen in England may have some clear knowledge of the
ways and customs of a large number of their brethren on the
Continent, I here intend to put down for their use a part of my
own knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>The majority of trades in Germany are formed into guilds, or
companies.&nbsp; At the head of each guild stands an officer
chosen by the government, whatever it may be&mdash;for you may
find a government of any sort in Germany, between an emperor and
a senate&mdash;this officer being always a master, and a member
of the guild.&nbsp; His title differs in almost every German
state, but he is generally called Trade-master, or Deputy.&nbsp;
Associated with him are two or three of the oldest employers; or,
in some cases, workmen in the trade, under the titles of
Eldermen, or Masters&rsquo; Representatives.&nbsp; These three or
four men govern the guild, and have under them, for the proper
transaction of business, a secretary and a messenger.&nbsp; Such
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>officers, however, do not represent their trade in the
whole state or kingdom, but are chosen, in every large town, to
conduct the multifarious business that may require attention
within its limits.</p>
<p>Although all these guilds are, in their original constitution,
formed on the same model, they differ materially in their
internal arrangements.&nbsp; Much depends upon the ruling
government of the state in which they are situated; for, while in
despotic Prussia, what is there called Freedom of Trade is
declared for all, in the &ldquo;free&rdquo; town of Hamburg
everything is bound and locked up in small monopolies.</p>
<p>In some parts of Germany there are &ldquo;close trades,&rdquo;
which means to say that the number of masters in each is
definitely fixed.&nbsp; This is so in Hamburg.&nbsp; For
instance, among the goldsmiths, the number of new masters
annually to be elected is three, being about sufficient to fill
up the deficiencies occurring from death and other causes.&nbsp;
I have heard of as many as five being elected in one year, and I
have also heard it asserted that this was to be accounted for on
the supposition that the aldermen had been &ldquo;smeared in the
hand,&rdquo; that is to say, bribed.</p>
<p>There are other trades locked up in a different way.&nbsp;
There exist several of this kind in Nuremberg and thereabouts;
as, the awl and punch-makers, lead-pencil makers, hand-bell
makers, gold and silver wire-drawers, and others.&nbsp; They
occupy a particular town or district, and they say, &ldquo;Here
we are.&nbsp; We possess these trades, and we mean to keep them
to ourselves.&nbsp; We will teach no strangers our craft; we will
confine it among our relatives and townsmen; and in order to
prevent the knowledge of it from spreading any farther, we will
allow our workmen to travel only within the limits of our town or
land;&rdquo; and so they keep their secrets close.</p>
<p>In other trades, the workmen are allowed to engage themselves
only to a privileged employer.&nbsp; That is to say, they dare
not execute a private order, but can receive employment from a
master of the craft only.&nbsp; In Prussia, and some few other
lands, each workman can work on his own account, and can offer
his goods for sale in the public market unhindered, so long as
they are the production of his own hands alone; but should he
employ a journeyman, then he pays a tax to Government of about
ten shillings annually, the tax increasing in proportion to the
number of men he may employ.</p>
<p>There are also &ldquo;endowed&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unendowed&rdquo; trades.&nbsp; An endowed guild is one the
members of which pay a certain small sum monthly <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>while
in work, and thus form a fund for the relief of the sick and the
assistance of the travelling members of the trade.&nbsp; There
are few trades of the unendowed kind, for the workmen of such
trades have to depend upon the generosity of their companions in
the craft in the hour of need; and it is generally found more
economical to pay a regular sum than to be called on at uncertain
intervals for a donation; moreover, the respectability of the
craft is better maintained.</p>
<p>While we talk of respectability, we may add that it was
formerly the especial care of the heads of each guild, to see
that no disreputable persons became members of the trade; and
illegitimate children, and even the lawful offspring of
shepherds, bailiffs, and town servants were carefully
excluded.&nbsp; This practice exists no longer, except in some
few insignificant places; but the law is still very general which
says that no workman can become a master who has not fulfilled
every regulation imposed by his guild; that is to say, he must
have been apprenticed at the proper age to a properly-constituted
master; must have regularly completed his period of
apprenticeship, and have passed the appointed time in
travel.&nbsp; The worst part of all these regulations is, that,
as they vary in almost every state, the unfortunate wanderer has
to conform to a new set of laws in every new land he enters.</p>
<p>One other regulation is almost universal.&nbsp; Each guild
must have a place of meeting; not a sumptuous hall, but mere
accommodation in a public-house.&nbsp; It is called the
&ldquo;Herberge,&rdquo; and answers, in many respects, to our
&ldquo;House of Call.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the weary
traveller&rsquo;s place of rest&mdash;he can claim a shelter
here; indeed, in most cases, he dares sleep nowhere else.&nbsp;
Here also the guild holds its quarterly meetings.&nbsp; By way of
illustration, let us take the Goldsmith&rsquo;s Herberge in
Hamburg; the &ldquo;Stadt Bremen&rdquo; is the sign of the
house.&nbsp; In it, the goldsmiths use a large, rectangular
apartment, furnished with a few rough tables and chairs, and a
wooden bench running round its four walls.&nbsp; On the tables
are arranged long clay pipes, and in the centre of each table is
a small dish of what the uninitiated might take to be dried tea
leaves.&nbsp; This is uncut tobacco, which the host, the father
of the House of Call, is bound to provide.&nbsp; The secretary
and messenger of the guild of goldsmiths are there, together with
one or two of the &ldquo;Altgesellen&rdquo; (elder journeymen),
who perform the active part of the duties of the guild.&nbsp; The
minutes of the last meeting, and the incidents of <!-- page
27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the
quarter&mdash;possibly, also, an abstract of the
rules&mdash;having been read, and new officers, to supersede
those who retire, having been balloted for, the business of the
evening closes.&nbsp; Then commences a confusion of tongues; for
here are congregated Russians, Hungarians, Danes, Hamburgers,
Prussians, Austrians; possibly there may be found here a member
of every state in the German Union.&nbsp; None are silent, and
the dialect of each is distinct.&nbsp; Assiduously, in the pauses
of his private conversation, every man smokes his long pipe, and
drinks his beer or punch.&nbsp; Presently two female harp-players
enter&mdash;sources of refreshment quite as popular in Hamburg as
the punch.&nbsp; They strike up an infatuating waltz.&nbsp; The
effect is wonderful.&nbsp; Two or three couples (men waltzing
with men, of course) are immediately on their feet, scrambling,
kicking, and scraping round the room; hugging each other in the
most awkward manner.&nbsp; Chairs and tables are huddled into
corners; for the mania has seized upon two-thirds of the
company.&nbsp; The rest cannot forsake their beer, but congregate
in the corners, and yell, and scream toasts and
&ldquo;Lebe-hoch!&rdquo; till they are hoarse.</p>
<p>Two girls enter, with trifling articles of male attire for
sale; stocks, pomatum, brushes, and beard-wax; but the said
damsels are immediately pounced upon for partners.&nbsp; In the
intervals of the music a grand tournament takes place; the
weapons being clay-pipes, which are speedily shattered into a
thousand pieces, and strewn about the room to facilitate
dancing.&nbsp; Such a scene of shuffling, whirling, shouting, and
pipe-crunching could scarcely be seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>We will take a German youth destined to become an artisan, and
endeavour to follow him through the complication of conflicting
usages of which he stands the ordeal.&nbsp; Hans is fourteen
years of age, and has just left school with a decent
education.&nbsp; Hans has his trade and master chosen for him; is
taken before the heads of the guild, and his indenture duly
signed and sealed in their presence, they themselves witnessing
the document.&nbsp; His term of apprenticeship is probably four
years, perhaps six; a premium is seldom given, and when it is, it
shortens the period of apprenticeship.&nbsp; The indenture,
together with a certificate of baptism, in some cases that of
confirmation (which ceremony serves as an important epoch in
Germany), and even a documentary proof of vaccination, are
deposited in the coffers of the guild, and kept at the Herberge
for future reference.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Obedience to elders and superiors is the one great duty
inculcated in the minds of all Germans, and Hans is taught to
look upon his master as a second father; to consider short
commons as a regulation for his especial good, and to bear
cuffing&mdash;if he should fall in the way of
it&mdash;patiently.&nbsp; If he be an apprentice in Vienna, he
may possibly breakfast upon a hunch of brown bread, and an
unlimited supply of water; dine upon a thin soup and a block of
tasteless, fresh-boiled beef; and sup upon a cold crust.&nbsp; He
may fare better or worse; but, as a general rule, he will sleep
in a vile hole, will look upon coffee and butter as undeniable
luxuries, and know the weight of his master&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Hans has one great source of pleasure.&nbsp; There is a state
school, which he attends on Sundays, and where he is instructed
in drawing and modelling.&nbsp; In his future travels he will
find the advantage he has acquired over less educated mechanics
in this necessary knowledge; and should he come to England, he
will discover that his skill as a draughtsman will place him at
once in a position superior to that of the chance-taught workmen
about him.&nbsp; He completes his apprenticeship without
attempting to run away.&nbsp; That is practically impossible; but
he yearns, with all the ardour of a young heart, for the happy
day when he may tramp out of his native town with his knapsack on
his back, and the wide world before him.</p>
<p>We will suppose Hans out of his time, and declared a free
journeyman by the guild.&nbsp; The law of his country now has it
that he must travel&mdash;generally for three years, perhaps four
or six&mdash;before he can take up the position of a
master.&nbsp; He may work for a short period in his native town
as a journeyman, but forth he must; nor is he in any way
loth.&nbsp; One only contingency there is, which may serve to
arrest him in his course,&mdash;he may be drawn as a
conscript&mdash;and, possibly, forget in the next two or three
years, as a soldier, all he has previously learned in four as a
mechanic.&nbsp; But we suppose Hans to have escaped this peril,
and to be on the eve of his departure.</p>
<p>When an English gentleman, or mechanic, or beggar, in these
isles, has resolved upon making a journey, he has but to pack up
his traps, whether it be in his portmanteau, his deal-box, or his
pocket-handkerchief; to purchase his ticket at the railway or
steam-packet station; and without asking or consulting with
anybody about the matter, to take his seat in the vehicle, and
off he goes.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Not so Hans.&nbsp; He gives his
master fourteen days&rsquo; notice of his intention to wander;
applies to the aldermen of his guild for copies of the various
documents concerning himself in their possession; and obtains
from his employer a written attestation of his past
services.&nbsp; This document is called a
&ldquo;Kundschaft;&rdquo; is written in set form, acknowledges
his probity and industry, and is countersigned by the two
aldermen.&nbsp; He is now in a condition to wait upon the
&ldquo;Herberges-Vater&rdquo; (the landlord of the House of
Call), and request his signature also.&nbsp; The Vater, seeing
that Hans owes nothing to him or to any other townsman&mdash;and
all creditors know that they have only to report their claims at
the Herberge to obtain for them a strict attention&mdash;signs
his paper, &ldquo;all quit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely he may start
forth now!&nbsp; Not so; the most important document is still
wanting.&nbsp; He has, as yet, no passport or wander-book.</p>
<p>Hans goes to the police-bureau, and, as he is poor, has to
wait a long while.&nbsp; If Hans were rich, or an artist, or a
master&rsquo;s son, it is highly probable that ho would be able
to obtain a passport&mdash;and the possession of a passport
guarantees many advantages&mdash;but as Hans is simply a workman,
a &ldquo;wander-book&rdquo; only is granted to him.&nbsp; This
does indeed cost him less money, but it thrusts him into an
unwelcome position, from which it is not easy to escape.&nbsp; He
is placed under stricter rule, and, among other things, is
forced, during his wandering, to sleep at his trade Herberge,
which, from the very monopoly it thus enjoys, is about the worst
place he could go to for a lodging.</p>
<p>The good magistrate of Perleberg&mdash;the frontier town of
Prussia, as you enter from Mecklenburg&mdash;had the kindness to
affix to my passport a document entitled, &ldquo;Ordinance
concerning the Wandering of Working-men.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will
briefly translate its contents.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Verordnung&rdquo; commences with a preamble, to the effect
that, notwithstanding the various things that have been done and
undone with respect to the aforesaid journeymen, it still happens
that numbers of them wander purposeless about the land, to the
great burden of their particular trades and the public in
general, and to the imminent danger of the common safety.&nbsp;
Therefore, be it enacted, that &ldquo;passports,&rdquo; that is
to say, &ldquo;passes,&rdquo; in which the distinct purpose of
the journey is stated, such as a search for employment; or
&ldquo;wander-books,&rdquo; in which occupation by manual labour
is the especial object, are to be granted to those natives of
Prussia only who pursue a trade or art for the perfection of
which <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>travelling may be considered useful
or necessary.&nbsp; To those only who are irreproachable in
character, and perfectly healthy in body; this latter to be
attested by a medical certificate.&nbsp; To those only who have
not passed their thirtieth year, nor have travelled for the five
previous years without intermission.&nbsp; To those only who
possess a proper amount of clothing, including linen, as well as
a sum of money not less than five dollars (about sixteen
shillings) for travelling expenses.&nbsp; So much for
natives.&nbsp; Foreigners must possess all the above-named
requisites; must be provided with proper credentials from their
home authorities, and may not have been more than four weeks
without employment on their arrival at the frontier.&nbsp; Again,
every wanderer must distinctly state in what particular town or
city he intends to seek employment, and by what route he purposes
to get there; and any deviation from the chosen road (which will
be marked in the wander-book) will be visited by the punishment
of expulsion from the country.&nbsp; A fixed number of days will
be allotted to the wanderer in which to reach his destination,
but should he overstep that period, a similar punishment awaits
him; expulsion from the country always meaning that the offender
shall retrace his steps, and quit the land by the way he had
entered it.&nbsp; This is the substance of the
&ldquo;ordinance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hans is ready for the road.&nbsp; He has only now to take his
farewell.&nbsp; A farewell among workmen is simply a
drinking-bout, a parting glass taken overnight.&nbsp; Hans has
many friends; these appoint a place of assemblage, and invite him
thither.&nbsp; It is a point of honour among them that the
&ldquo;wandering boy&rdquo; shall pay nothing.&nbsp; Imagine a
large, half-lighted room; a crowded board of bearded faces.&nbsp;
On the table steams a huge bowl of punch, which the chosen head
of the party, perhaps Johann&rsquo;s late master, ladles into the
tiny glasses.&nbsp; He proclaims the toast, &ldquo;The Health of
the Wanderer!&rdquo;&nbsp; The little crowd are on their feet,
and amid a pretty tinkling of glasses, an irregular shout arises,
a small hurricane of voices, wishing him good speed.</p>
<p>What songs are sung, what healths are drunk, what heartfelt
wishes are expressed!&nbsp; The German workmen are good friends
to one another&mdash;men who are already away from friends and
home, and whose tenderest recollections are awakened in the
farewell expressed to a departing companion.&nbsp; Many tears are
shed, many hearty presses of the hand are given, and not a few
kisses impressed upon the cheek.&nbsp; Little tokens of affection
are interchanged, and <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>promises to write are made, but
seldom kept.&nbsp; With this mingling and outpouring of full
hearts, the stream of punch still flows through tiny glasses:
but, since &ldquo;Many a little makes a mickle,&rdquo; the
farewell thus taken ends sometimes as a debauch.</p>
<p>Hans, in the morning, is perhaps a little the worse for last
night&rsquo;s punch.&nbsp; He is attired in a clean white blouse,
strapped round the waist; a neat travelling-cap; low, stout
shoes; and, possibly, linen wrappers, instead of socks.&nbsp; The
knapsack, strapped to his back, contains a sufficient change of
linen, a coat artistically packed, which is to be worn in cities,
and a few necessary tools; the whole stock weighing, perhaps,
twenty or thirty pounds.&nbsp; On the sides of the knapsack are
little pouches, containing brushes, blacking, and soap; and in
his breast-pocket is stowed away a little flask of
brandy-schnaps, to revive his drooping spirits on the road.&nbsp;
A stout stick completes his equipment.&nbsp; A last adieu from
the one friend of his heart, who will walk a few miles with him
on the way&mdash;and so he is launched fairly on his journey.</p>
<p>Hans finds the road much harder, and his knapsack heavier than
he had expected.&nbsp; Now he is drenched with rain, and can get
no shelter; and, when he does, he will find straw an inconvenient
substitute for a bed.&nbsp; At last he arrives at Berlin.&nbsp;
He has picked up a companion on the road; and, as it frequently
happens that several trades hold their meetings in the same
house, they both are bound to the same Herberge.&nbsp; Through
strange, half-lighted streets, along narrow edges of pavement,
they proceed till they enter a court, or wynd, with no footpath
at all, and they are in the Schuster Gasse, before the door of
the Herberge.&nbsp; The comrade of Hans announces them as they
pass the bar, and the next moment they are in the
travellers&rsquo; room, amid as motley a group as ever met within
four walls.</p>
<p>Tumult and hubbub.&nbsp; An indescribable odour of tobacco,
cummin (carraway), and potato-salad.&nbsp; A variety of hustled
blouses.&nbsp; Sunburnt and haggard faces.&nbsp; Ragged beards
and unkempt locks.&nbsp; A strong pipe hanging from every lip;
beer, or k&uuml;mmil (a spirit prepared with cummin) at every
hand.&nbsp; Wild snatches of song, and hurried bursts of
dialogue.&nbsp; Some are all violence and uproar; some are half
dead with sleep and fatigue, their arms sprawling about the
tables.&nbsp; Such is the inside of a German trade
traveller&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Hans and his companion hand over their papers to the
&ldquo;father&rdquo; as a security, and their knapsacks to a
sluttish-looking girl, who <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>deposits them
in a cupboard in the corner of the room, and locks the door upon
them.&nbsp; Our travellers order a measure of Berliner Weiss
Bier, to be in keeping with the rest, and long for the hour of
sleep.&nbsp; At length, a stout young man enters, carrying a
lighted lantern, and in a loud voice of authority summonses all
to bed.&nbsp; And there is a scrambling and hustling among some
of the travellers, a hasty guzzling of beer and spirits, and a
few low murmurs at being disturbed, but none dare disobey.</p>
<p>A shambling troop of sixteen or eighteen, they quit the room,
and enter a small paved yard, preceded by the young man with the
lantern.&nbsp; There is a rough building resembling a stable, at
the other end of the yard; and, in one corner, a steep ladder,
with a handrail, which leads to a chamber above.&nbsp; They
ascend, and enter a long, low loft, so completely crowded with
rough bedsteads that there remains but a narrow alley between
them, just sufficient to allow a single person to pass.&nbsp;
Eight double beds, and the ceiling so low that the companion of
Hans can scarcely stand upright with his hat on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New-comers this way,&rdquo; shouts the conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, now?&rdquo; inquires Hans of
his comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your coat,&rdquo; is the answer in a whisper;
&ldquo;undo the wristbands, and throw open the collar of your
shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be examined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they are examined; and, being pronounced sound, are allowed
to sleep with the rest of the flock.&nbsp; In this loft, each bed
with at least two occupants, and the door locked&mdash;without
consideration for fire, accident, or sudden
indisposition,&mdash;Hans passes the first night in Berlin.</p>
<p>But there is no work in Berlin, and Hans must pursue his
journey.&nbsp; He waits for hours at the police-office, as
play-goers wait at the door of a London theatre.&nbsp; By and by,
he gets into the small bureau with a desperate rush.&nbsp; That
business is settled, and he is off again.&nbsp; Time runs on;
and, after a further tramp of good two hundred miles, Hans gets
settled at last in the free city of Hamburg.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few factories, such as the silk-works
at Chemnitz, in Saxony, and the colony of goldsmiths at
Pfortzheim, in Wurtemburg, there are few extensive manufactories
in Germany.&nbsp; Trade is split up into little masterships of
from one to five or six men.&nbsp; <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>This
circumstance materially affects the relation between the employer
and employed.</p>
<p>The master under whom Hans serves at Hamburg is a pleasant,
affable gentleman; his apprentice Peter may be of a different
opinion, but that is of no consequence.&nbsp; The master has
spent the best years of his life in England and France; has
learned to speak the languages of both countries with perfect
facility, and is one of the lucky monopolists of his trade.&nbsp;
He employs three workmen; one of them, who is possessed of that
peculiar cast of countenance generally attributed to the children
of Israel, has been demurred to by the Guild,&mdash;and
why?&nbsp; Because a Jew is legally incapable of working in
Hamburg.&nbsp; He is, however, allowed the usual privileges on
attesting that he is not an Israelite.</p>
<p>Our master accommodates under his own roof one workman and his
apprentice Peter.&nbsp; The others, whom he cannot lodge, are
allowed each one mark-banco (fourteen pence) per week, to enable
them to find a bed-chamber elsewhere.&nbsp; They suffer a
pecuniary loss by the arrangement.&nbsp; Hans sleeps in a narrow
box, built on the landing, into which no ray of heaven&rsquo;s
light had ever penetrated.&nbsp; His bedding is a very simple
affair.&nbsp; He is troubled with neither blankets nor
sheets.&nbsp; An &ldquo;under&rdquo; and an &ldquo;over&rdquo;
bed, the latter rather lighter than the former, and both supposed
to be of feathers, form his bed and bedding.&nbsp; Hans is as
well off as others, so he does not complain.&nbsp; As for the
apprentice, Peter, it was known that he disappeared at a certain
hour every evening; and from his appearance when he turned out in
the morning, Hans was under the impression that he wildly shot
himself into some deep and narrow hole, and slept the night
through on his head.</p>
<p>And how does Hans fare under his master&rsquo;s roof?&nbsp;
Considering the reminiscences of his apprenticeship, he relishes
his cup of coffee in the morning; his tiny round roll of white
bread; the heavy black rye-loaf, into which he is allowed to hew
his way unchecked; and the beautiful Holstein butter.&nbsp; Not
being accustomed to better food, it is possible that he enjoys
the tasteless, fresh boiled beef, and the sodden baked meat, with
no atom of fat, which form the staple food at dinner.&nbsp;
Whether he can comprehend the soups which are sometimes placed
before him,&mdash;now made of shredded lemons, now of strained
apples, and occasionally of plain water, with a sprinkling of
rice, is another matter; but the sourkraut and bacon, the boiled
beef and raisins, <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and the baked veal and prunes, are
certain to be looked upon by him as unusual luxuries.</p>
<p>The master presides at the table, and blesses the meat with
the air of a father of his people.&nbsp; Although workmen in
Germany are little better than old apprentices, this daily and
familiar intercourse has the effect of breaking down the formal
barriers which in England effectually divide the capitalist and
the labourer.&nbsp; It creates a respectful familiarity, which
raises the workman without lowering the master.&nbsp; The manners
of both are thereby decidedly improved.</p>
<p>Hans gradually learns other trade customs.&nbsp; His comrade
falls sick, and is taken to the free hospital, a little way out
of the city.&nbsp; This hospital is clean and well kept, but
fearfully crowded.&nbsp; The elder journeymen of the Guild are
there too, and they comfort the sick man, and hand him the weekly
stipend, half-a-crown, allowed out of the sick-fund.&nbsp; Hans
contributes to this sick-fund two marks&mdash;two shillings and
fourpence&mdash;a quarter.&nbsp; He does it willingly, but the
master has power to deduct it from his wages in the name of the
Guild.&nbsp; His poor sick friend dies; away from home and
friends&mdash;a desolate being among strangers.&nbsp; But he is
not, therefore, to be neglected.&nbsp; Every workman in the trade
is called upon to contribute his share&mdash;about
sevenpence&mdash;towards the expenses of the funeral; and the two
senior, assisted by four other journeymen, in full evening dress,
attend his funeral.&nbsp; His effects are then carefully packed
up, and sent&mdash;a melancholy memorial of the dead&mdash;to his
relations.</p>
<p>From the same fund which relieves the sick, are the
&ldquo;wandering boys&rdquo; also assisted.&nbsp; But the
&ldquo;Geschenk&rdquo; (gift), as it is called, is a mere trifle;
sometimes but a few pence, and in a large city like Berlin it
amounts to but twenty silver groschen&mdash;little more than two
shillings.&nbsp; It is not considered disgraceful to accept this
donation; as all, when in work, contribute towards the fund from
which it is supplied.</p>
<p>And what is the amount of wages that German workmen
receive?&nbsp; In Hamburg wages vary from five to eight marks per
week, that is, from seven shillings to ten and sixpence, paid
monthly.&nbsp; In Leipsic they are paid fortnightly, and average
about ten shillings per week.&nbsp; In Berlin wages are paid by
the calendar month, and average twenty-four dollars (a dollar is
rather more than three shillings), for that period; so that a
workman may be said to earn about eighteen shillings a week, but
is dependent on his own resources for food and lodging.&nbsp; In
Vienna the same regulation exists, and wages range <!-- page
35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>from
five to eight guldens&mdash;ten to sixteen shillings per
week&mdash;paid weekly, as in England.&nbsp; But a workman in
Vienna may be respectably lodged, lighted, and washed for at the
rate of half-a-crown a week.&nbsp; In Berlin and Vienna married
journeymen are to be met with, but not in great numbers, and in
smaller towns they may almost be said to be unknown.&nbsp; Dr.
Korth, in his address to his young friends, the &ldquo;travelling
boys,&rdquo; on this subject, emphatically
says&mdash;&ldquo;Avoid, in God&rsquo;s name, all attachments to
womankind, more especially to those of whom your hearts would
say, &lsquo;These could I love.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the
quaint old gentleman proceeds to say a number of ungallant
things, which are not worth translating.</p>
<p>No! the German workman is taught to hold himself free, that he
may carry out the law of his land to the letter; that he may
return from his travels at the appointed time &ldquo;a wiser and
a better man;&rdquo; that he may show proofs of his acquired
skill in his trade, and thereupon claim the master&rsquo;s right
and position.&nbsp; He is then free to marry, and is looked upon
as an &ldquo;eligible party.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how seldom does all
this come to pass, may the thousands who swarm in London and
Paris; may the German colonies which dot the American States,
sufficiently tell.&nbsp; Many linger in large cities till they
feel that to return to the little native village, and its old,
poor, plodding ways, would be little better than burial alive;
and some return, wasted with foreign vice and purchased
adversity, premature old men, to die upon the threshold of their
early homes.</p>
<p>One more question&mdash;what are their amusements?&nbsp; It
would be a long story to tell, but certainly home-reading is not
a prominent enjoyment among them.&nbsp; German governments, as a
rule, take care that the people&rsquo;s amusements shall not be
interfered with.&nbsp; The workmen throng in dance-houses,
beer-cellars, caf&eacute;s, and theatres, which are all liveliest
and most attractive on a Sunday; and, as they are tolerably
cheap, they are generally a successful lure from deep thinking or
study.&nbsp; Besides, the German workman has no home.&nbsp; If he
stay there at all in holiday hours, it is to draw, or model, or
sing romances to the strumming of his guitar.</p>

36</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">hamburg to
l&uuml;beck</span>.</p>
<p>The bleak, icy winter of North Germany is past.&nbsp; We have
trodden its accumulated snows as they lay in crisp heaps in the
streets of Hamburg; and have watched the muffled crowd upon the
frozen Alster, darting and reeling, skating, sliding, and
sleighing upon its opaque and motionless surface.&nbsp; We have
alternately loved and execrated the massive German oven, which
warmed us indeed, but never showed us a cheerful face.&nbsp; We
have sipped our coffee or our punch in the beautiful winter
garden of Tivoli, under the shade of lemon-trees, with fragrant
flowers and shrubs around us; and finally, have looked upon the
ice-bound Elbe with its black vessels, slippery masts, and rigid
cordage, and seen the Hanoverian milk lasses skimming its dun
expanse laden with their precious burdens.&nbsp; We have got over
the slop and drizzle, and half-thawed slush, too; and the
boisterous March wind dashes among the houses; and what is better
than all, the fresh mornings are growing brighter and longer with
every returning sun.</p>
<p>Away, then, out of the old city, alone on the flat, sandy road
that lies between Hamburg and Berlin.&nbsp; Here we are, with
hope before us, resolution spurring us on, and a twenty-eight
pound knapsack on our backs.&nbsp; Tighten the straps, my friend,
and you will walk easier with your load.</p>
<p>My journey as a workman on the tramp from Hamburg to Berlin I
propose to tell, as simply as I can.&nbsp; I have no great
adventures to describe, but I desire to illustrate some part of
what has already been said about the workmen in Germany, and I
can do this best by relating, just as it was, a small part of my
own road experience, neither more nor less wonderful than the
experience which is every day common to thousands of Germans.</p>
<p>I was very poor when I set out from Hamburg in the month of
March, with my knapsack strapped to my back, my stick in my hand,
and my bottle of strong comfort slung about my neck after <!--
page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>the manner of a locket.&nbsp; I was not poor in my own
conceit, for I had in my fob&mdash;the safest pocket for so large
a sum of money&mdash;two gold ducats and some Prussian dollars:
English money, thirty-five shillings.&nbsp; I thought I was a
proper fellow with that quantity of ready cash upon my person,
and a six weeks&rsquo; beard on my chin.</p>
<p>Many adieus had been spoken in Hamburg at our last
night&rsquo;s revel, but a Danish friend was up betimes to see me
out of town.&nbsp; At length he also bade the wanderer farewell,
and for the comfort of us both my locket having passed from hand
to hand, he left me to tramp on alone, over the dull, flat, sandy
road.&nbsp; There was scarcely a tree to be seen, and the sky
looked like a heavy sheet of lead, but I stepped out boldly and
made steady progress.&nbsp; The road got to be worse; I came
among deep ruts and treacherous sloughs, and the fields on each
side of the road were flooded.&nbsp; In some parts the road was a
sand swamp, and the walk became converted into a gymnastic
exercise; a leaping about towards what seemed the hard and knobby
places that appeared among the mud.&nbsp; This exercise soon made
me conscious of the knapsack, to which I was then not thoroughly
accustomed.&nbsp; It was not so much the weight that I felt, but
the tightness of the belt across the chest, which caused pain and
impediment of breathing.&nbsp; Custom, however, caused the
knapsack to become even an aid to me in walking.</p>
<p>A sturdy young fellow who did not object to mud was pushing
his way recklessly behind me.&nbsp; I was soon overtaken, we
exchanged kind greetings, and jogged on together, shoulder to
shoulder.&nbsp; He had been upon his travels; had been in Denmark
for two years, and had left Copenhagen to return to his native
village, that lay then only eight or ten miles before us.&nbsp;
What was his reason for returning?&nbsp; He was required to
perform military service, and for the next two years at
least&mdash;or for a longer time, should war break out&mdash;was
doomed to be a soldier.&nbsp; He did not think the doom
particularly hard, and we jogged on together in a cheerful mood
until his knowledge of the ground became distressingly familiar,
and he illustrated portions of the scenery with tales of robbery
and murder.&nbsp; The scenery of the road became at every turn
more picturesque.&nbsp; Instead of passing between swampy fields,
it ran along a hollow, and the ground was on each side broken
into deep holes with rugged edges; black leafless bushes stood
out from the grey and yellow sand, while farther away in the
background, against the leaden sky, there was a sombre fringe of
thickly planted fir-trees.&nbsp; <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>The daylight,
dim at noon, had become dimmer as evening drew near; the grey sky
darkened, and the tales of robbery and murder made my thoughts
anything but cheerful.&nbsp; As the hills grew higher on each
side of us, it occurred to us both that here was a fine place for
a murder, and I let my companion go before, handling my stick at
the same time as one ready to strike instantly if any injury were
offered.&nbsp; I was just demonstrative enough to frighten my
companion.&nbsp; We were a mere couple of rabbits.&nbsp; Each of
us in his innocence feared that the other might be a guilty
monster, and so we were both glad enough to get out of the narrow
pass.&nbsp; On the other side of the glen the road widened, and
my companion paused at the head of a little path that led down to
a deeper corner of the hollow, and across the fields.&nbsp; That
was his way home.&nbsp; He had but a mile to go, and was already
anticipating all the kisses of his household.&nbsp; He wished me
a prosperous journey; I wished him a happy welcome in his
village; and we shook hands like two young men who owed amends to
one another.</p>
<p>He had told me before we parted that there were two houses of
entertainment not far in advance.&nbsp; Already I saw the
red-tiled roof of one, that looked like a respectable
farm-house.&nbsp; From the door of that house, however, I was
turned away; and as the darkness of the evening was changing into
night, I ran as fast as I was able to the next place of
shelter.&nbsp; By the pump, the horse-trough, and the dirty pool
I knew that there was entertainment there for man and
horse.&nbsp; I therefore raised the wooden latch, and in a modest
tone made my request for a bed.&nbsp; A vixenish landlady from
the midst of a group of screaming children cried to me,
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a bed, you can have
straw.&rdquo;&nbsp; That would do quite as well, I said.</p>
<p>I sat down at a table in a corner of the large room, called
for a glass of beer, produced some bread and sausage that I had
brought with me from Hamburg, and made a comfortable
supper.&nbsp; There was a large wood fire blazing on the ample
hearth, but the landlord and his family engrossed its whole
vicinity.&nbsp; The house contained no other sitting-room and no
other sleeping accommodation than the one family bedroom and the
barn.</p>
<p>While I was at supper there came in other wandering boys like
myself.&nbsp; I had escaped the rain, but they had not; they came
in dripping: a stout man, and a tall, lank stripling.&nbsp; The
youth wore a white blouse and hat covered with oil-skin; his
trousers were tucked halfway up his legs, and he had mud up to
his ankles.&nbsp; We <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>soon exchanged our scraps of
information about one another.&nbsp; The stout man was a baker
from L&uuml;beck on the way to Hamburg; the stripling, probably
not yet out of his teens, was part brazier, part coppersmith,
part tinman; had been three weeks on his travels, and had come,
like myself, from Hamburg since morning.&nbsp; He was very
poor.&nbsp; He did not tell us that; but he ordered nothing to
eat or drink, and except the draught of comfort that he got out
of my bottle, the poor fellow went supperless to bed.&nbsp; Not
altogether supperless though, for he had some smoke.&nbsp; We
made a snug little party in the corner, and talked, smoked, and
comforted ourselves, after the children had been put to bed, and
while the landlord, landlady, and an old grandfather told stories
to each other in Low German by the fire.&nbsp; At nine
o&rsquo;clock the landlord lighted his lantern, and told us
bluffly that we might go to bed.&nbsp; We therefore, having
handed him our papers&mdash;passports and wander-books&mdash;for
his security and for our own, followed into the barn.&nbsp; That
was a place large enough to hold straw for a regiment of
soldiers.&nbsp; It was a continuation of the dwelling-house,
sheltered under the same roof.&nbsp; We mounted three rude
ladders, and so got from floor to floor into the loft.&nbsp;
Having guided us safely thither, he quitted us at once with a
&ldquo;good night;&rdquo; taking his lantern with him, and
leaving us to make our beds in the thick darkness as we
could.&nbsp; The straw was not straw: it was short-cut hay, old
enough to have lost all scent of hay, and to have acquired some
other scents less pleasing to the nose; hay, trodden, pressed,
and matted down, without a vestige in it of its ancient
elasticity.&nbsp; There was nothing in it to remind us of a
summer tumble on the hay-cock.&nbsp; The barn roof was open, and
the March night wind whistled over us.&nbsp; I took off my boots
to ease my swollen feet; took my coat off that I might spread it
over my chest as a counterpane; and struggled in vain to work a
hole for my feet into the hard knotted bank of hay.&nbsp; So I
spent the night, just so much not asleep that I was always
conscious, dimly, of the snoring of the baker, and awoke
sometimes to wonder what the landlord&rsquo;s cock had supped
upon, for it was continually crowing in its sleep, on the
barn-floor below.&nbsp; When morning broke we rose and had a
brisk wash at the pump, scraped the mud from our boots, and
breakfasted.&nbsp; The baker and I had plain dry bread and hot
coffee.&nbsp; The tinman breakfasted on milk.&nbsp; He said it
was better&mdash;poor fellow! he knew it was cheaper.&nbsp; By
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>seven o&rsquo;clock we were all afoot again, the baker
journeying to Hamburg, the tinman and I road-companions to
L&uuml;beck.</p>
<p>At noon, after a five hours&rsquo; walk, a pleasant roadside
inn with a deep gable roof and snug curtains behind its lattice
windows, tempted me to rest and dine.&nbsp; &ldquo;We shall get a
good dinner here,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;let us go
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tinman would hear of no such thing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must get on to L&uuml;beck,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Two more hours of steady walking and we shall be
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor youth!&nbsp; At L&uuml;beck he could
demand a dinner at his herberge, and he had no chance of any
other.&nbsp; So we trudged on till the tall turrets and steeples
of L&uuml;beck rose on the horizon.&nbsp; The tinman desired to
know what my intentions were.&nbsp; Was I going straight on to
Berlin without working?&nbsp; Should I seek work at
L&uuml;beck?&nbsp; If not, of course I would take the
<i>viaticum</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought not,&rdquo; I told
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have some
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; The viaticum is the tramp-money that may be
claimed from his guild by the travelling workman.&nbsp; Germans,
like other people, like to take pills gilded, and so they cloak
the awkward incident of poverty under a Latin name.</p>
<p>L&uuml;beck being in sight we sat down upon a grassy bank to
make our toilet.&nbsp; A tramp&rsquo;s knapsack always has little
pouches at the side for soap, brushes, and blacking.&nbsp; We
were not so near to the tall steeples as we thought, and it took
us a good hour and a half before we reached the city gates.&nbsp;
The approaches are through pretty avenues of young trees and
ornamental flower-plots.&nbsp; The town entrance at which we
arrived was simply a double iron gate, like a park gate in
England.&nbsp; As we were about to pass in, the sentinel beckoned
and pointed us towards a little whitened watchbox, at which we
stopped to hand our papers through a pigeon-hole.&nbsp; In a few
minutes the police officer came out, handed to me my passport
with great politeness, and in a sharp voice bade the tinman
follow him.&nbsp; Such is the difference between a passport and a
wander-book.&nbsp; I, owner of a passport, might go whither I
would: tinman, carrying a wander-book, was marched off by the
police to his appointed house of call.&nbsp; I took full
advantage of my liberty, and, as became a weary young man with
two gold ducats in his fob, went to recruit my strength with the
best dinner I could get.&nbsp; Having taken off my knapsack and
my blouse, I soon, therefore, was indulging in a lounge upon the
sofa of one of the best hotels in the sleepy and old-fashioned
free city of L&uuml;beck.</p>
<h2><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">l&uuml;beck to
berlin</span>.</p>
<p>By right of churches full of relics, antique buildings, and
places curiously named, L&uuml;beck is, no doubt, a jewel of a
town to antiquarians.&nbsp; Its streets are badly paved, but
infinitely cleaner than the streets of Hamburg.&nbsp; I did not
much wonder at that, for I saw no people out of doors to make
them dirty, when I exposed myself to notice from within doors as
a solitary pedestrian, upon my way to take a letter to a
goldsmith in the market place.&nbsp; The market place is a kind
of exchange; a square building with an open court in the centre,
around which there is a covered way roofed quaintly with carved
timbers.&nbsp; In this building the mechanical trades of
L&uuml;beck are collected, each trade occupying a space
exclusively its own under the colonnade.&nbsp; Here, all the
tradesmen are compelled to work, but are not permitted to
reside.&nbsp; Each master has his tiny shop-front with a trifling
show of goods exposed in it, and his small workshop behind, in
which, at most, two or three men can be employed.&nbsp; In some
odd little nooks the doors of these boxes are so arranged, that
two masters cannot go out of adjoining premises at the same time
without collision.</p>
<p>Though my friend in L&uuml;beck was a stranger, as a brother
jeweller he gave me friendly welcome.&nbsp; Having inquired into
my resources, he said, &ldquo;You must take the
<i>viaticum</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is like begging,&rdquo; I
answered.&mdash;&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;you
pay for it when you are in work, and have a right to it when
travelling.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But I might find employment, on
inquiry.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Do not be alarmed, my friend; there
is not a job to be done in the whole city.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
forced, therefore, by my friend&rsquo;s good-natured earnestness,
to make the usual demand throughout the little group of
goldsmiths, and having thus satisfied the form, I was conducted
to our Guild alderman and treasurer.&nbsp; A little quiet
conversation passed between them, and the cash-box was then
emptied out into my hand; <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>it contained
twenty-eight Hamburg shillings, equal to two shillings in English
money.</p>
<p>I returned to my hotel and slept in a good bed that
night.&nbsp; The morning broke heavily, and promised a
day&rsquo;s rain.&nbsp; Through the lowering weather and the
dismal streets I went to the police office to get my passport
<i>vis&eacute;d</i> for Schwerin in Mecklenburg.&nbsp; Most
dismal streets!&nbsp; The L&uuml;beckers were complaining of loss
of trade, and yearned for a railway from L&uuml;beck to
Hamburg.&nbsp; But the line would run through a corner of
Holstein, and no such thing would be tolerated by the Duke.&nbsp;
The L&uuml;beckers wanted the Russian traffic to come through
their town and on to Hamburg by rail.&nbsp; The Duke of Holstein
wished to bring it through his little port of Kiel upon the
Baltic.</p>
<p>Too poor to loiter on the road, having got my passport
<i>vis&eacute;d</i>, I again strapped the knapsack to my back,
and set out through the long avenues of trees over the long, wet
road, through bitter wind and driving rain.&nbsp; Soaked with
rain, and shivering with cold, I entered the village of
Sch&ouml;neberg at two o&rsquo;clock, just after the rain had
ceased, as deplorable a figure as a man commonly presents when
all the vigour has been washed out of his face, and his clothes
hang limp and damp about his body.&nbsp; Wearied to death, I
halted at the door of an inn, but was told
inhospitably&mdash;miserable tramp as I seemed, and
was&mdash;that &ldquo;I could go to the next house.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At the next house they again refused me, already humbled, and
advised me to go to The Tall Grenadier.&nbsp; That is a house of
call for masons.&nbsp; I went to it, and was received there
hospitably.&nbsp; My knapsack being waterproof, I could put on
dry clothes, and hang my wet garments round the stove, while the
uproarious masons&mdash;terrible men for beer and
music&mdash;comforted me with unending joviality.&nbsp; They got
into their hands a book of German songs that dropped out of my
knapsack, and having appointed a reader, set him upon the table
to declaim them.&nbsp; Presently, another jolly mason cried out
over a drinking song&mdash;declaimed among the others in a loud
monotonous bawl&mdash;&ldquo;I know that song;&rdquo; and having
hemmed and tuned his voice a little, broke out into music with
tremendous power.&nbsp; The example warmed the others; they began
to look out songs with choruses, and so continued singing to the
praise of wine and beauty out of my book, until they were warned
home by the host.&nbsp; I climbed a ladder to <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>my bedroom,
and slept well.&nbsp; The Grenadier was not an expensive hotel,
for in the morning when I paid my bill for bed and breakfast, I
found that the accommodation cost me fourpence-halfpenny.</p>
<p>Since it is my desire not to fatigue the reader of this
uneventful narrative, but simply to illustrate by a few notes
drawn from my own experience the life of a German workman on the
tramp, I shall now pass over a portion of the road between
Hamburg and Berlin in silence.&nbsp; My way lay through Schwerin;
from Sch&ouml;neberg to Schwerin is twenty-six English miles, and
we find it a long way.&nbsp; In reckoning distances, the Germans
count by &ldquo;stunden&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> hours&mdash;and
two &ldquo;stunden&rdquo; make one German mile.&nbsp; From
experience, I should say that five miles English were about equal
to one mile German; but they vary considerably.&nbsp; Having
spent a night in the exceedingly neat city of Schwerin beside its
pleasant waters, and under the protection of the cannon in the
antiquated castle overhead, I set out for a walk of twenty miles
onward to Ludwigslust.&nbsp; The road was a pleasant one, firm
and dry, with trim grass edgings and sylvan seats on either
side.&nbsp; The country itself was flat and dull, enlivened only
now and then by a fir plantation or a pretty village.&nbsp;
Brother tramps passed me from time to time with a cheerful
salutation, and at three o&rsquo;clock I passed within the new
brick walls of Ludwigslust; a town dignified as a pleasure seat
with a military garrison, a ducal palace, and an English
park.</p>
<p>The inn to which I went in Ludwigslust, was the house of call
for carpenters.&nbsp; The carpenters were there assembled in
great force, laughing, smoking, and enjoying their red wine,
which may have come from France, for Mecklenburg is no wine
country.&nbsp; It was the quarter-day and pay-day of the
carpenters, who were about to celebrate the date as usual with a
supper.&nbsp; I went to sit down in the small travellers&rsquo;
room, and was assailed instantly by the whole army of joiners,
some with bleared eyes; with flushed faces under caps of every
shape and colour; and a flexible pipe hanging from every
mouth&mdash;Who was I?&mdash;What was I?&mdash;Whence did I
come?&mdash;Where was I born? and whither was I going? etc.,
etc.&nbsp; When they had found out all about me and confirmed
their knowledge by examination of my passport, which one dull dog
persisted in regarding as a book of ballads, out of which he
sang, I began to ask concerning food.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing warm
in the house,&rdquo; said the housefather, a carpenter
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be a grand supper at six <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>o&rsquo;clock, and everything and everybody is wanted in
the preparation of it.&nbsp; Make yourself easy for the present
with brown bread and dripping, and a glass of beer, and then you
can make your dinner with us when we sup.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
suited me well enough.</p>
<p>The carpenters flowed out into the street, to take a stroll
and get their appetites, leaving behind them one besotted man,
who propped himself against the oven, and there gave himself a
lecture on the blessings of equanimity under all circumstances of
distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you sleep here to-night?&rdquo; inquired the
host.&nbsp; Certainly, I desired to do so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you
must go to the police bureau for a
permission.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But you have my passport; is not
that sufficient?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not in Ludwigslust; your
passport must be held by the police, and they will give you in
exchange for it a ticket, which I must hold, or else I dare not
let you have a lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went to the police office
at once; through the ill-paved street into the middle of the
town.&nbsp; I went by a large gravelled square, which serves as a
riding ground for the cavalry in the adjoining barracks; and a
long broad street of no great beauty, ending in a flight of
steps, led me then to the police office, and would have led me
also, had that been my destination, to the ducal palace.&nbsp;
The palace fronts to a paved square; it is a massive, noble
edifice of stone, having before it a fine cascade with a treble
fall.&nbsp; To the left, across a green meadow, I observed the
church&mdash;the only church&mdash;a simple whitewashed building
with a colonnaded front.&nbsp; At the foot of the low flight of
steps was the police office, in which I found one man, who
civilly copied my passport into a book, put it aside, and gave me
a ticket of permission to remain one night in Ludwigslust.&nbsp;
I was desired to call for my passport before leaving in the
morning.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock there was no sign of supper.&nbsp; At
eight o&rsquo;clock the cloth was spread in a long, low
lumber-room at the back of the inn, and the assembled carpenters
took their seats before the board, or rather boards supported
upon tressels.&nbsp; I took my place and waited hungrily.&nbsp;
Very soon there was a great steam over the whole table sent up
from huge tureens of boiled potatoes; smaller dishes of preserved
prunes, boiled also, occupied the intervals.&nbsp; A bottle of
red wine was placed for every two men.&nbsp; We then began our
meal with soup; thin, sorry stuff.&nbsp; Then came the chief
dishes, baked veal and baked pig&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The prunes
were to be eaten with the veal, which meat, having been first
boiled to make the soup, and then baked in a deep dish in a close
oven to bring out some of the <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>faded
flavour, was a sodden mass, and the whole meal was removed a very
long way from the roast fillet of veal and pickled pork known to
an Englishman.&nbsp; Our pig&rsquo;s head was, however,
capital,&mdash;no soup had been made out of that.&nbsp; The
carpenters, with assiduous kindness, heaped choice bits upon my
plate, and as I had not dined, I supped with energy.&nbsp; The
drunken man who had fallen asleep by the stove sat by my side
with greedy looks, eating nothing, for he had not paid his share;
he was a man who drank away his gains, and he received no
pity.</p>
<p>Then after supper there came toasts.&nbsp; The president was
on his legs, all glasses were filled; men ready.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Long live the Guild of carpenters!&nbsp; Vivat
h&mdash;o!&rdquo; The ho! was a howl; the glasses clashed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Long live all carpenters!&nbsp; Vivat
ho&mdash;o!&rdquo;&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock there was a bustle
and confusion at the door, and a long string of lads marched, two
and two, cap in hand, into the room.&nbsp; These were all the
carpenters&rsquo; apprentices in Ludwigslust.&nbsp; Every
quarterly night the hospitable carpenters have them in after
supper to be regaled with beer and cordials, and initiated into
the mysteries of jollity that are connected with the existence of
a master carpenter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Long live all carpenters&rsquo;
apprentices!&nbsp; Vivat ho&mdash;o&mdash;o!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
apprentices having revelled in as much beer and spirits as could
be got through, shouting included, in a quarter of an hour,
formed double line again, and marched out under a fire of lusty
cheers into the street.&nbsp; Some jolly carpenters still
lingered in the supper room, smoking or singing choruses, or
making partners of each other for mad waltzes round the table to
the music of their tongues.</p>
<p>Longing for bed, I was obliged to wait until the landlord was
at leisure to attend to me.&nbsp; After I rose next morning, I
waited for three hours impatiently enough until the sleepy host
had risen; for until I had received my ticket back from him I was
unable to get my passport and go on.&nbsp; At length, however, I
got out of the brick walls of Ludwigslust, and marched forward
under a clear sky on the way to Perleberg, my next stage, distant
about fifteen English miles.</p>
<p>Having passed through two dirty, ill-paved towns, and being in
some uncertainty about the road, I asked my way of a short,
red-faced man who, being himself bound for the frontier station,
favoured me so far with his company.&nbsp; He was a post-boy
whose vocation was destroyed, but who was nevertheless blessed
with <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>philosophy enough to recognise the merits of the railway
system, and to point out the posts marking the line between
Berlin and Hamburg, with the comment that &ldquo;the world must
move.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed to be enough for him that he lived
in the recollection of the people on his old road-side, and that
he could stop with me outside a toll-gate, the first I had seen
in Germany, sure of the production of a bottle for a social dram,
in which I cordially joined.&nbsp; Then presently we came to a
small newly-built village, the Prussian military station.&nbsp; A
sentinel standing silent and alone by his sentry box striped with
the Prussian colours, black and white, marked where the road
crossed the Prussian frontier.&nbsp; We passed unchallenged, and
found dinner upon the territory of the Black Eagle, in a very
modest house of entertainment.</p>
<p>Travelling alone onward to Perleberg, I stopped once more for
refreshment at a melancholy, dirty place, having one common room,
of which the chairs and tables contained as much heavy timber as
would build a house.&nbsp; I wanted an hour&rsquo;s rest, for my
knapsack had become a burden to me, and the handles of the few
tools I was obliged to carry dug themselves relentlessly into my
back.&nbsp; &ldquo;White or brown beer?&rdquo; asked the
attendant.&nbsp; Dolt that I was to answer Brown!&nbsp; They
brought me a vile treacley compound that I could not drink;
whereas the Berlin white beer is a famous effervescing liquor; so
good, says a Berliner, that you cannot distinguish it from
champagne if you drink it rapidly with closed eyes, and at the
same time press your nose between your fingers.&nbsp; In the
evening I got to Perleberg, and walking wearily up the old,
irregular High Street, established myself at the Londoner
Schenke&mdash;the London Tavern.&nbsp; I found the parlour
pleasant and almost private, the hostess quiet and
lady-like.&nbsp; While she was getting coffee ready for me, I
paid my call of duty upon the police; for though my passport had
been <i>vis&eacute;d</i> to Berlin in half a dozen places, the
law required that I should not sleep in a new kingdom without
first announcing my arrival.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the market place I found a red brick
building with a gloomy door, opening upon a broad stone
staircase, by which I mounted to the magistrate&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; That was a lofty hall, badly lighted by two little
windows, and scantily furnished with a few seats.&nbsp; Behind a
railing sat the magistrate in a velvet skull-cap and black robe;
a short fat man with a satisfied face, but unsatisfied and
restless eyes.&nbsp; Two armed soldiers shared with him the space
beyond the rail.&nbsp; Two townsmen, hat in hand, were patiently
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>waiting for their passes.&nbsp; Having mentioned my
business, I was told that I might wait; standing, of
course.&nbsp; The heavy quiet of the room was broken presently by
the entrance of two young workmen in clean blouses, bound upon an
errand like my own, who hovered in a tremulous condition near the
doorway.</p>
<p>The magistrate of Perleberg, after awhile, looked at my
passport, and asked &ldquo;Have you the requisite amount of
travelling money to show?&rdquo;&nbsp; I had not expected such a
question, but the two gold ducats were still in my fob, and I
produced them with the air of a fine gentleman.&nbsp; One of the
soldiers took them in his hand, examined them and passed them to
his comrade, who passed them to the townspeople.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are good,&rdquo; said the soldier, as he put them
back into my hand.&mdash;&ldquo;Is that enough?&rdquo; I asked,
as though there had been thousands of such things about other
parts of my person, for I saw that I had made an
impression.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the
magistrate, &ldquo;you may sit down.&rdquo;&nbsp; O miserable
homage before wealth!&nbsp; They would not keep me standing.</p>
<p>It had grown dark, and a lighted candle had been placed upon
the desk of the chief magistrate, a most diligent man in his
office, who, seeing no description of my person in the passport,
set to work with the zest of an artist upon the depiction of my
features.&nbsp; Examining each feature minutely with a candle, he
put down the results of his researches, and then finally read off
his work to me with this note at the bottom&mdash;&ldquo;The
little finger of his left hand is crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostess of the London Tavern, when I got back to my
quarters, must have heard about my wealth.&nbsp; That pleasant
little maiden lady told me all about her house, and how it had
been named afresh after the King of Prussia slept there on his
way to London, where he was to act as sponsor to the Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; I, who had been turned away from the doors of the
humblest inns, was flattered and courted by a landlady who had
entertained His Majesty of Prussia.&nbsp; The neatest of
chambermaids conducted me to an elegant
bedchamber&mdash;&ldquo;her own room,&rdquo; the little old maid
had said as I left her&mdash;and there I slept upon the couch
sacred to her maiden meditations, among hangings white as
snow.</p>
<p>The next morning I went out into Perleberg,&mdash;a ricketty
old place, full of rats and legends.&nbsp; There is a colossal
figure in the market-place of an armed knight, eighteen or twenty
feet high, gazing eternally into the fruit baskets below.&nbsp;
He has his head uncovered, his hand upon his sword, and is made
of stone; but who he <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>is nobody seemed to know; I was only
told that the statue would turn any one to stone who fixed his
eyes upon it in intense gaze for a sufficiently long time.&nbsp;
I visited the chief jeweller, a wonderful man, who was said to
have visited nearly all parts of the known world except London
and Paris.&nbsp; I found him with one workman, very busy, but not
doing much; and he was very civil, although manifestly labouring
under the fear that I had come to ask for a
&ldquo;<i>viaticum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not.&nbsp; I went back
to eat a hearty breakfast at the London Tavern, where I found the
mistress gracious, and the handmaid very chatty and
coquettish.&nbsp; From her talk I half concluded that I was
believed to be an Englishman who travelled like a journeyman for
the humour of the thing: the English are so odd, and at the
London Tavern they had not been without experience of English
ways.&nbsp; My display of the gold pieces must have been
communicated to them overnight, by one of the townspeople who
heard me tell the magistrate at what inn I was staying.</p>
<p>From Perleberg to Keritz was eighteen miles.&nbsp; Upon the
road I came up with a poor fellow limping pitiably.&nbsp; He had
a flat wooden box upon his back, being a tramping glazier; and he
made snail&rsquo;s progress, having his left thigh swollen by
much walking.&nbsp; I loitered with him as long as my time
allowed, and then dashed on to recover the lost ground.&nbsp;
Passing at a great pace a neat road-side inn, singing the while,
a jolly red face blazed out upon me from the lattice
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ei da!&nbsp; You are merry.&nbsp; Whither so
fast?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To Berlin.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wait an
instant and I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two odd figures
tumbled almost at the end of the instant out of the house
door.&nbsp; One a burly man with a red face and a large
moustache, the other a chalky young man with a pair of Wellington
boots slung round his neck.&nbsp; They were both native Prussians
on the way from Hamburg to Berlin, having come through Magdeburg,
travelling, they declared, at the rate of about six-and-twenty
English miles a day.&nbsp; These Prussians will talk; but at
whatever rate my friends might have travelled, they were nearly
dead beat.&nbsp; They had sent on their knapsacks by the waggon,
finding them unmercifully heavy.&nbsp; The stout traveller had a
white sack over his shoulders, his trousers tucked up to his
knees, and his Wellington boots cut down into ankle-jacks to ease
his chafed shins, that were already dotted with hectic red spots
from over-exertion.&nbsp; His young friend carried his best
Wellingtons about his neck, and wore a pair of cracked boots,
through which I could see the colour, in some places, <!-- page
49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of
his dark blue socks, in other places of his dark red flesh.&nbsp;
Both were lamed by the same cause, inflammation of the front of
the leg, in which part I also had begun to feel some
smartings.</p>
<p>We got on merrily, in spite of our legs, and overtook two very
young travellers, whom I recognised as the flutterers before the
presence of the magistrate at Perleberg.&nbsp; One proved to be a
bookbinder, the other a wood-turner.&nbsp; They were fresh upon
their travels, and their clean white blouses, the arrangements of
their knapsacks, and the little neatnesses and comforts here and
there about them, showed that they had not yet travelled many
days&rsquo; march from a mother&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; Then we
toiled on, until our elder friend grew worse and worse about his
feet, laughing and joking himself out of pain as he was
able.&nbsp; Finally, he could go no farther, and we waited until
we could send him forward in a passing cart.</p>
<p>He being dispatched, we travelled on, I and my friend with the
boot-necklace, till we met a little crowd of men in blouses,
little queer caps, knapsacks, and ragged beards, all carrying
sticks.&nbsp; They were travelling boys like ourselves, bound
from Berlin to Hamburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; they
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; we answered, shouting in
unison as we approached each other.&nbsp; When we met, a little
friendly skirmish with our sticks was the first act of
greeting.&nbsp; A storm of questions and replies then
followed.&nbsp; We all knew each other in a few minutes;
carpenters, turners, glovers were there,&mdash;not a jeweller
among them but myself.&nbsp; We parted soon, for time was
precious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love to Berlin,&rdquo; cried one of them
back to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;My compliments to Hamburg,&rdquo; I
replied; and then we all struck up an amatory chorus of the
&ldquo;Fare thee well, love&rdquo; species, that fitted properly
with our position.</p>
<p>Continuing upon our way we found our lame companion smoking a
pipe comfortably outside the village inn at Warnow.&nbsp; His
cart was resting there for bait to man and horse.&nbsp; We baited
also and discussed black bread-and-butter, and Berlin white beer,
till the cart carried away our moustachioed friend, never again,
perhaps, to meet us in this world, and not likely to be
recognised by his moustachios in the other.</p>
<p>My chalky comrade, who was also very lame, lay on the ground
in a desperate condition before the day was over, and it was with
some difficulty that I brought him safe by nightfall into
Wusterhausen.&nbsp; He had become also mysterious, and evidently
inquisitive <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>as to the state of my finances,
exhibiting on his own part hasty glimpses of a brass medal
wrapped up in fine wool, which he wished me to look upon as a
double ducat.&nbsp; When we got to the inn-door, my friend made a
hurried proposition very nervously, which made his purpose
clear.&nbsp; There were sixty English miles of road between us
and Berlin; he was knocked up, and a fast coach, or rumbling
omnibus, accommodating six insides, would start for Berlin in the
morning.&nbsp; He thought he could bargain with the coachman to
take us to Berlin for a dollar&mdash;three shillings&mdash;a
piece, if I did not mind advancing his fare, because he did not
want to change the double ducat until he got home.&nbsp; I put no
difficulty in his way, for he was a good fellow, and moreover
would be well able to help me in return, by telling me the
addresses of some people I depended upon finding in Berlin.&nbsp;
He proceeded, therefore, into the agonies of bargaining, and was
not disappointed in his expectation.&nbsp; At the price of a
dollar a-piece we were packed next morning in a frowsy vehicle,
tainted with much tobacco-smoke, to which he came with his
swollen feet pressed only half-way down into the legs of his best
Wellingtons.&nbsp; The ride was long and dull, for there was
little prospect to be caught through the small, dirty window; and
the air tasted of German tinder.&nbsp; From a cottage villa on
the roadside, a German student added himself to the three
passengers that started from Wusterhausen.&nbsp; He came to us
with a pipe in his mouth, unwashed, and hurriedly swaddled in a
morning gown, carelessly tied with a cord about the middle.&nbsp;
After a few miles travelling the vehicle was full, and remained
full&mdash;until we at last reached Berlin.</p>
<p>There I found no work, and wandered listlessly through the
museums and picture-galleries; for a troubled mind is a poor
critic in works of art.&nbsp; So I squeezed myself into the
Police Court, meaning to leave Berlin, and had the distinction of
being beckoned, before my turn out of the reeking mass of
applicants for passports, because my clothes had a respectable
appearance, and I wore a showy pin in my cravat.</p>
<h2><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">berlin</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">our herberge</span>.</p>
<p>Fairly in Prussia!&nbsp; We have passed the frontier town of
Perleberg, and press onward in company with a glovemaker of
Berlin, last from Copenhagen, whom we have overtaken on the road
towards Wusterhausen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wouldst know, good friend, the nature of my
prospects in Berlin when I arrive there?&nbsp; Have I letters of
recommendation&mdash;am I provided in case of the worst?&nbsp;
Brother, not so!&nbsp; I am provided for nothing.&nbsp; I dare
the vicissitudes of fortune.&nbsp; I had a friend in Hamburg, a
Frenchman, who departed thence five months ago for Berlin, under
a promise to write to me at the lapse of a month.&nbsp; He has
never written, and he is my hope.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Let us
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a cousin,&rdquo; says the glovemaker, &ldquo;who
is a jeweller in Berlin.&nbsp; I will recommend you to him.&nbsp;
His name is Kupferkram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&nbsp; I knew a Kupferkram in Hamburg; a short,
sallow man, with no beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Prussian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be that my cousin was in Hamburg and I not
know it.&nbsp; I was there twelve months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; A German will be anywhere in the course
of twelve months except where you expect to find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Gottlob&mdash;Gottlob
Kupferkram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very man!&nbsp; Does he not lisp like a child, and
his father sell sausages in the stadt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Donnerwetter!&nbsp; Ja!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may not appear to be of much importance, but to me it is
everything; for upon the discovery of this vender of sausages
depends my meeting with my best and only friend in Berlin,
Alcibiade Tourniquet, of Argenteuil, the Frenchman before
mentioned.&nbsp; It is at least a strange coincidence.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>We came into the capital of Prussia in the eil-wagen
from Wusterhausen.&nbsp; We had tramped the previous day a
distance of good two-and-thirty English miles, through a flat,
uninteresting country, and being dead beat, had made an anxious
bargain with the driver of the &ldquo;Fast-coach,&rdquo; to carry
us to Berlin for a dollar a-head.&nbsp; It was late in the
evening as we rumbled heavily along the dusty road, and through
the long vista of thick plantations which skirt the public way as
you enter the city from Spandau.&nbsp; We dismounted, cramped and
weary, from our vehicle, and my companion, a native of Berlin,
unwilling to disturb his friends at that late hour, and in his
then travel-worn guise; and I myself being unknown and unknowing
in the huge capital, led the way at once to &ldquo;Our
Herberge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English term &ldquo;House of Call&rdquo; is but an
inadequate translation of the German
&ldquo;Herberge.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must be remembered that the
German artisan is ruled in everything by the state; for while
English workmen, by their own collective will, raise up their
trade or other societies, in whatever form or to whatever purpose
their intelligence or their caprices may dictate to them, the
German, on the contrary, discovers among his very first
perceptions that his position and treatment in the world is
already fixed and irrevocable.&nbsp; He becomes numbered and
labelled from the hour of his birth, and the gathering items of
his existence are duly recorded&mdash;not in the annals of
history&mdash;but in the registry of the police.&nbsp; Thus he
finds that the State, in the shape of his Zunft or Guild, is his
Sick Benefit Club and his Burial Society, his Travellers&rsquo;
Fund and his Trade Roll-Call; aspires indeed to be everything he
ought to desire, and certainly succeeds in being a great deal
that he does not want.</p>
<p>I have a little paper at my hand presented to me by the police
of Dresden, which may help to elucidate the question of
associations of workmen in Germany.&nbsp; It is an
&ldquo;Ordinance&rdquo; by which &ldquo;We, Frederick Augustus,
by God&rsquo;s grace King of Saxony, &amp;c., &amp;c., make known
to all working journeymen the penalties to which they are liable
should they take part in any disallowed &lsquo;workmen&rsquo;s
unions, tribunals, or declarations;&rsquo;&rdquo; the said
penalties having been determined on by the various governments of
the German Union.&nbsp; &ldquo;Independently,&rdquo; says the
Ordinance, &ldquo;of the punishment&rdquo; (not named)
&ldquo;which may be inflicted for the offence, the delinquent
shall be deprived of his papers, which shall be sealed up and
sent to his home Government.&nbsp; On his release from prison(!)
he shall <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>receive a restricted pass for his
immediate and direct return home; and on his arrival there he
shall be strictly confined within its limits, nor ever be
permitted to travel into the other states of the German Union,
until by a long course of repentance and good behaviour his home
government may think him worthy of such a favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
will easily be understood from this that mechanics&rsquo; or
other institutions, independent of the government, are
unknown.</p>
<p>The German Herberge is the home of the travelling
workman.&nbsp; It should be clean and wholesome; there should he
be provided, together with simple and nutritious food, every
necessary information connected with his trade, and such aid and
reasonable solace as his often wearisome pilgrimage
requires.&nbsp; All this is to be rendered at a just and
remunerative price, and it is usually supposed that the
fulfilment of these requisites is guaranteed by the care and
surveillance of the police.&nbsp; But this is a fiction.</p>
<p>Our Herberge is in the Schuster-gasse; and a vile,
ill-conditioned, uncleanly den it is; nor, I am sorry to say, are
its occupants, in appearance at least, unworthy of their
abode.&nbsp; But we must not be uncharitable; it is a hard task
this tramping through the length and breadth of the land; and he
is a smart fellow who can keep his toilet in anything like decent
condition amid the dust, the wind, the pelting rain or the
weltering sunshine that beset and envelope him on the implacable
high road.&nbsp; As there is no help, we take our places among
the little herd of weary mortals without a murmur; among the
ragged beards and uncombed locks; the soiled blouses and
travel-worn shoe-leather; the horny hands and embrowned visages
of our motley companions.&nbsp; We are duly marshalled to bed at
eight o&rsquo;clock with the rest; huddled into our loft where
nine beds await some sixteen occupants; and having undergone the
customary examination as to our freedom from disease and vermin,
are safely locked in our dormitory, to be released only at the
good will of the &ldquo;Vater&rdquo; in the morning.</p>
<p>Your German is truly a patient animal; the laws of his Guild
compel him to wander for a period of years, but the laws of his
country do not provide him with even the decencies of life upon
the road.&nbsp; With his humble pack, and his few hoarded
dollars, he sets forth upon the road of life; he is bullied and
hustled by the police upon every step of his journey; burdened
with vexatious regulations at every halting-place; and while the
law forbids him to seek any other shelter than that of his
Herberge, it leaves it to the <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>mercy of his
host to yield him the worst fare, spread for him the vilest
litter, and to filch him of his scanty savings in the
bargain.&nbsp; What, in Heaven&rsquo;s name! are the
accommodations for which we in the Schuster-gasse are called upon
to pay?&nbsp; There is the common room with its rude benches and
tables; a stone-paved court-yard with offices, doubtless at one
period appropriated as stabling, but the ground floor of which is
now penned off for some few choice biped occupants; while the
story above, reached by a railed ladder, and, in fact, no more
than a stable loft, is nightly crammed to the door with
sweltering humanity.&nbsp; For the purpose of cleanliness there
is no other toilette apparatus than the iron pump in the yard;
and for the claims of nature and decency, no better resource than
is afforded by the sheltering arch of the nearest bridge over the
Spree.</p>
<p>The goldsmiths and jewellers in Berlin are too inconsiderable
a body to have a Herberge of their own, and therefore we crowd in
with the turners, the carpenters, and the smiths; the
glove-makers, bookbinders, and others who claim the hospitalities
of the asylum in the Schuster-gasse.&nbsp; Let us take a sketch
or two among them that may serve as a sample of the whole.</p>
<p>We have a sturdy young carpenter from Darmstadt, bound to
Vienna, or wherever else he may find a resting-place, who makes
his morning and almost only meal of <i>K&uuml;mmel</i>&mdash;corn
spirit prepared with caraways&mdash;and brown bread; and whose
great exploit and daily exercise is that of lifting the great
table in the common room with his teeth.&nbsp; An iron-jawed
fellow he is, with every muscle in his well-knit body to
match.&nbsp; Fortunately, though a Goliath in strength, he is as
simple-minded and joyous as a child.</p>
<p>Then comes a restless pigmy of a Hungarian, a jeweller, last
from Dresden, full of life and song, but who complains ruefully
that the potatoes of Berlin are violently anti-dyspeptic.&nbsp;
This suffering wanderer from the banks of the Theiss is also
vehemently expressive in his opinion that the indiscriminate use
of soap is injurious to the skin, and, as a matter of principle,
never uses any.</p>
<p>Near him stands a lank native of L&uuml;beck, a fringe-maker,
whose whole pride and happiness is concentrated in his ponderous
staff of pilgrimage; a patriarchal wand, indeed! rightly
bequeathed as an heirloom from father to son, and in its state
and appearance not unworthy of the reverence with which it is
regarded.&nbsp; It is no flimsy cane to startle flies with, but a
stout stem some six feet long, duly peeled, <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>scraped and
polished, and mounted with a chased head of massive silver.</p>
<p>Close by his side an effeminate leather-dresser from Carlsruhe
sits stroking his yellow goat&rsquo;s beard.&nbsp; Instead of
strapping his knapsack to his back like a stalwart youth, after
the manly fashion of his forefathers when on the tramp, he
trundles behind him as he goes, a little iron chaise loaded with
his pack and worldly equipage.</p>
<p>There broods a sombre cordwainer from Bremen, gloating over
his enormous pipe, in form and size like a small barrel, raising
an atmosphere for himself of the fumes of coarse uncut
<i>knaster</i>.&nbsp; He has doffed his white kittel (blouse),
and has wriggled himself into a short-waisted, long-skirted,
German frock-coat, which, having been badly packed in his
knapsack, exhibits every crease and wrinkle it has acquired
during a three weeks&rsquo; march.&nbsp; Know, friend, that the
skilful folding of apparel, to be worn on his arrival in every
important town, is one of the necessary acquirements of the
German wanderer.</p>
<p>Add to these a rollicking saddler from Heldesheim, who figures
in a full beard, a rich cluster of crisp, brown curls, his own
especial pride, and the object of deep envy to his less hirsute
companions; and who, far too fond of corn brandy-wine, goes about
singing continually the song of the German tramp, &ldquo;<i>Ich
Liebe das liederliche Leben</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;This vagabond life
I delight in!&mdash;an earnest, quiet student, who, for reasons
of economy, has made the Schuster-gasse his place of refuge; and
a dishevelled button-maker, last from Hamburg, who has just
received his geschenck, or trade-gift, amounting to fifteen
silver groschens, about eighteenpence in English money; and who
ponders drearily over it as it lies in the palm of his hand,
wondering how far this slender sum will carry him on the road to
Breslau, his native place, still some two hundred miles away.</p>
<p>We have among us the wily and the simple, the boisterous and
the patient, the taciturn and the unruly; but though they will
sing songs before they go to sleep, and swagger enormously among
themselves, they become as still and meek as doves at the voice
of the Herberges-Vater (the father of the Herberge), and quake
like timid mice beneath the eye of the police.</p>

56</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">a street in
berlin</span>.</p>
<p>Berlin is a fine city, let the wise Germans of the East say
what they will.&nbsp; It may be deficient in those monumental
records of &ldquo;the good old times,&rdquo; the crumbling
church, the thick-walled tower, the halls and dungeons of feudal
barbarism, but it abounds with evidences of the vigour and life
of modern taste and skill; and instead of daily sinking into
rotten significance, like some of its elder brethren, is hourly
growing in beauty and strength.&nbsp; It has all the attributes
of a great city&mdash;spacious &ldquo;places,&rdquo; handsome
edifices, broad and well-paved streets.&nbsp; Its monuments,
while they are evidences of great cultivation in the arts, tell
of times and events just old enough to be beyond the ken of our
own experiences, yet possess all the truth and vividness of
recent history.&nbsp; &ldquo;Der Alter Fritz,&rdquo; Blucher,
Zieten, Seyditz, Winterfeldt, Keith, and &ldquo;Der Alter
Dessauer&rdquo;&mdash;what names are these in Prussian story!</p>
<p>The entrance into Berlin, on the western side, from Spandau,
by the Brandenburger Gate, is the finest that the capital of
Prussia has to present.&nbsp; A thickly-planted wood skirts the
road for a mile or two before you reach the city.&nbsp; The trees
are dwarfed and twisted, for they cannot grow freely in the
dense, eternal sands of this part of North Germany, but they form
a rough fringing to the white road; while the noble gate itself,
built of massive stone in the Doric order of architecture, and
surmounted by an effective group of a four-horse chariot, within
which stands the figure of Victory raising the Roman eagle above
the almost winged steeds, might grace the entrance to the city of
the C&aelig;sars.</p>
<p>This Brandenburger Thor, as it is called, is a copy of the
Propyl&aelig;a of the Acropolis of Athens, but built on a much
grander scale.&nbsp; The central gate is of iron, eighteen feet
high; of the fourteen land gates of Berlin it is immeasurably the
finest, and it acquires a still deeper interest when some
enthusiastic Berliner, pointing to the prancing steeds upon the
summit of the arch, tells you how Napoleon in his admiration had
ordered this self-same group to be transported to <!-- page
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Paris
in 1807, to ornament a French &ldquo;<i>arch de
triomphe</i>,&rdquo; and how &ldquo;We, the Prussians,&rdquo; had
torn the spoil from the eagle&rsquo;s very nest in 1814, to
replant it on its original site.&nbsp; A glow of military ardour
flushes over your heart at the recital, and the echoes of a
hundred battles thunder in your ears.</p>
<p>Through this gate, which is in the Dorotheen Stadt, after
crossing the Square of Paris, we enter upon one of the handsomest
streets in the world, and one bearing the most poetical of
titles: &ldquo;Unter-den-Linden,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Under the
Lime Trees!&rdquo;&mdash;there is something at once charming and
imposing in the very sound.&nbsp; Nor is this appellation an
empty fiction, for there stand the lime trees themselves, in two
double rows with their delicate green leaves rustling in the
breeze, forming a two-fold verdant all&eacute;e, vigorous and
fragrant, down the centre of the street, and into the very heart
of the city.&nbsp; Unter-den-Linden itself is two thousand seven
hundred and fifty-four feet in length, and one hundred and
seventy-four in width; but it extends, under another title, for a
much greater distance.&nbsp; This is the summer evening&rsquo;s
ramble of your true Berliner, and not a little proud and pompous
he is as he parades himself and family beneath the leafy canopy;
and here, in the snowy winters, when the city lies half buried in
the snowdrift, the gaily dressed sleighs go skimming under the
leafless branches, filling the bright cold air with the music of
their bells.</p>
<p>As we proceed deeper into the city, we find gay shops and
stately houses.&nbsp; A noble range of buildings appropriated to
the foreign embassies rises upon the left hand, and is succeeded
by the Royal Academy; while some distance beyond stands the
University, an edifice of a rather sombre appearance, although
graced with columns and pilasters of the Corinthian order.&nbsp;
To enter it you traverse a spacious court-yard, and it may be
that the nature of its contents impart a melancholy character to
the building itself; for, on ascending its stone staircase, and
wandering for a brief period among its bottles and cases, its wax
models and human preserves, we find them of so unsightly and
disgusting a character that we are happy to regain the echoing
corridor which had led us into this huge, systematised
charnel-house.</p>
<p>As we cross to the opposite side of the broad street, the
Royal Library faces us; a massive temple of stored knowledge,
polyglot and universal; while to the right of it, in the centre
of a paved space of considerable extent, stands the Catholic
church of St. Hedwig, <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>at once a model of Roman
architecture, and the emblem of the liberty of faith.</p>
<p>Close at hand is the Opera-house, once already purified by
fire, like so many of its companion edifices, and only lately
rebuilt.&nbsp; Some idea may be formed of the extent of its
interior from the fact that it affords accommodation for three
thousand spectators.&nbsp; Our way lies onward still.&nbsp; What
noble figure is this?&nbsp; Simple but commanding in character
and attitude, it fixes your attention at once.&nbsp; Look at the
superscription.&nbsp; Upon a scroll on its pedestal are the words
&ldquo;Frederick William III. to Field Marshal Prince Blucher of
Wahlstatt, in the year 1826.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes! the impetuous
soldier, figured in eternal bronze by the first sculptor of
Prussia, Rauch himself, here claims and receives the admiration
of his countrymen.&nbsp; Bare-headed stands the old warrior, but
is duly crowned with laurels on every returning anniversary of
the well remembered day, the 18th of June.</p>
<p>Leaving the sanctuary of the Christian Deity, the heathen
temple of Terpsichore, and the effigy of the renowned soldier,
thus grouped together, we traverse the fine road, and pause for a
moment to look at a severe but elegant structure, erected, we are
told, in exact imitation of a Roman <i>castrum</i>, or fortress,
and therefore eminently in character with the purpose for which
it is intended.&nbsp; The smart Prussian infantry are grouped
about its pillared entrance, which is graced also by two statues
of military celebrities&mdash;for this is the royal
guard-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Der Alter Fritz.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Old
Fred!&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the familiar title bestowed upon a
great monarch; and there is something in this nickname a thousand
times more telling to the ear and heart of a Prussian than the
stately appellation of &ldquo;Frederick the Great.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The former is for their own hearts and homes, the latter for the
world.&nbsp; And for the world also is the noble equestrian
statue upon which we now gaze.&nbsp; It is a question whether a
work of sterling genius does not speak as effectively to the eye
of the uninitiated as to that of the most inveterate stickler for
antecedents of grace and technicalities of beauty.&nbsp; This
statue of Frederick of Prussia tells upon the sense at once,
because it is true to art as established by ancient critics, but
more so, because it is imitated nature, which art too often only
presumes to be, reckoning too much upon fixed rules and
time-honoured dogmas.&nbsp; It is noble and impressive, because
it <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>is <i>like</i>; no antiquated Roman figure in
<i>toga</i> and <i>calcei</i>, but the representation of the
living man.</p>
<p>Das Zeughaus, or arsenal, which we now approach, is a massive
quadrangular building, and the warlike character of its
architectural decorations strikingly indicate the nature of its
contents.&nbsp; We pass through the open gate into an inner
court, and looking round upon the sombre walls which inclose us,
see the fearful faces of dead and dying men, cut in stone, which
the taste or caprice of the architect has considered their
fittest ornament.&nbsp; There is something strangely original and
attractive in the grotesque hideousness of these heads, agonised
with pain, scowling in anger, or frightful with their upturned
eyes in the rigidity of death, all bleached and shadowed as they
are by the vicissitudes of the weather.</p>
<p>Within the arsenal we find walls of glistening steel, columns
of lances, architectural and other devices worked out in dagger
blades and pistol handles; while battered armour and faded
draperies, in the shape of pennons and standards, storm and
battle-tattered, help to make up trophies, and swing duskily in
every corner.</p>
<p>After a rapid survey, we are about to leave this magazine of
Bellona, when we are struck by the sight of an object which
reminds us so completely of one of those &ldquo;gorgeous
processions&rdquo; in Eastern &ldquo;spectacles&rdquo; at home,
that we wonder for a moment whether it be &ldquo;part of the
play,&rdquo; or tangible, sober reality.&nbsp; Yes! placed upon a
scarlet cushion lies an enormous gilt key (such a one as clown in
the pantomime might open his writing-desk with, or such as hangs
over a locksmith&rsquo;s door), and above it glistens a golden
legend to the effect that the treasure beneath was presented to
&ldquo;William of Prussia by his loving cousin, Nicolas, Emperor
of all the Russias,&rdquo; and is no less a prize than the
identical key of the captured city of Adrianople!&nbsp; Has,
then, the Russian Emperor so many such trophies of Eastern
spoliation that his own museums at Petersburg are insufficient to
contain them?</p>
<p>Up the steep way towards the residence of the Prince of
Prussia, guarded by its zealous sentries, we pursue our course,
and reach the first bridge we have yet seen, being one of the
very many which span the Spree as it meanders through the
city.&nbsp; This river does not present an imposing appearance in
any part of Berlin.&nbsp; The Berliners may shake their heads,
and talk of the &ldquo;Lange Br&uuml;cke,&rdquo; but let them
remember that in no part does the Spree exceed two hundred feet
in width.&nbsp; Moreover, the manner in which it is jammed <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>up between locks, like a mere canal&mdash;one is puzzled
sometimes to know which is canal and which river&mdash;does not
improve its appearance, while the use to which some of its
bridges are appropriated does not increase its purity.&nbsp;
Passing onwards we come upon the Schloss Platz, which is itself
half a garden, and find ourselves in the midst of an assemblage
of public wonders&mdash;the Museum, the Protestant Cathedral, a
handsome basin and fountain (the pride of the true Berliner), the
Exchange, and the Old Palace.</p>
<p>The Museum stands on the left-hand, gracefully shaded by young
trees.&nbsp; Traversing this miniature grove, which guards its
entrance, and passing by the lofty fountain scattering its spray
upon the leaves, we come upon an elegant vase of gigantic
proportions, sculptured from a solid mass of native
granite.&nbsp; Ascending into the body of the building by a
sombre stone staircase, we reach the Gallery of Antiquities and
the Museum of Paintings.&nbsp; The latter, though no doubt very
valuable, appeals unsatisfactorily to me (not presuming to be a
critic), and is of a peculiarly rigid, ecclesiastical character,
of the early school; certainly one of its chief features is a
crowd of martyred St. Sebastians.</p>
<p>The portion of the Museum appropriated to painting, unlike the
National Gallery of London, and the Pinakothek at Munich,
receives a lateral light.&nbsp; Imagine a long gallery divided
into small cabinets by partitions, which advance only so far from
the outer wall as to leave a commodious passage along its entire
extent; imagine also that each of these cabinets has a lofty
window, and that on its side walls (the partitions) are suspended
the paintings for exhibition,&mdash;and you will form something
like a notion of the general arrangement.&nbsp; An effective
<i>ensemble</i> is out of the question; but, on the other hand,
every painting is well lighted, and a better opportunity is
afforded for quiet observation and study.</p>
<p>We descend into the &ldquo;Platz,&rdquo; and proceed towards
the palace, a huge rectangular building, striped with columns,
dotted with windows, and blackened as few continental edifices
are.</p>
<p>The palace of the kings of Prussia&mdash;few as they have
been&mdash;has surely its thrilling historical records.&nbsp;
Doubtless; and through them all the spirit of the <i>one</i>
king, &ldquo;Der Alter Fritz,&rdquo; shines, all but
visible.&nbsp; Here did he hold his councils, here sit in private
study; this was his favourite promenade, here did he take his
rest.&nbsp; These details light up the imagination; but when we
have traversed the echoing galleries, admired the gilt mouldings
and the costly <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>hangings, the quaint furniture and
beautiful pictures: when we have, in short, become wrought into
enthusiasm by the clustering memories of a great monarch, by
traits and traditions which fill the very air, what do we see
next?&nbsp; We are ushered into a private chamber, and called
upon to express our especial reverence for a miserable figure,
dressed up in the Great Frederick&rsquo;s &ldquo;own
clothes;&rdquo; seated in his own chair, stuck into his identical
boots; his own redoubtable stick dangling from its splayed
fingers, and the whole contemptible effigy crowned by the very
three-cornered hat and crisp wig he last wore!&nbsp; The spirit
of mountebankism overshadows the spirit of the mighty man, and
his very relics are rendered ridiculous.</p>
<p>We turn from this puppet-show to contemplate with a melancholy
wonder the truly iron records of the almost life-imprisonment of
Baron von Trenck.&nbsp; For here, a silent memorial of at least
one bad act of the Prussian monarch, are iron cups and utensils
engraved with scrolls and legends; the work, not of the skilled
artisan with tempered and well-prepared gravers, but of the
patient hands of a state prisoner with a mere nail sharpened on
the stony walls of his dungeon, and the painful result of long
and weary years.&nbsp; A strange contrast! the waxen image of the
jailer, tricked out in his last garments; the solitary labours of
his captive.</p>
<p>Thinking more of the soldier and less of the king, we quit the
palace and turn on the left hand once more towards the waters of
the Spree.&nbsp; Here is one other monument we must not forget in
our hasty ramble through the main artery of the Prussian
capital.&nbsp; In the centre of the Lange Br&uuml;cke (the Long
Bridge) stands the bronze figure of the last Elector and Duke of
Brandenburg, Frederick William, the grandfather of Frederick the
Great.&nbsp; It is a well-executed equestrian statue, but to my
mind the four figures clustered round the pediment, on whose
hands still hang the broken chains of slavery, are better works
of art, as well as admirable emblems of the energetic
materials&mdash;the oppressed but spirited inhabitants of a few
small states&mdash;of which the now powerful kingdom of Prussia
was originally formed.</p>
<p>We might follow the course of the wandering river over whose
waters we now stand, and thus penetrate into the heart of the old
city, but we should find little that was picturesque, and a great
deal that was very unclean.&nbsp; Indeed, in spite of its general
beauty, Berlin is lamentably deficient in the modern and
common-place <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>article, sewerage.&nbsp; But even
this will come; and in the meantime we may well ponder over the
rapid growth of the city, since the brief space of time that has
elapsed since it was the little town of Cologne upon the Spree,
to distinguish it from the then greater one of Cologne upon the
Rhine.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">berlin</span>.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">police and people</span>.</p>
<p>It may not appear correct to an English reader to couple the
people and the police thus cavalierly together, but in Prussia,
as in the rest of Germany, the police are so completely bound up
in, and their services so entirely devoted to, the every-day
existence, as well as any more prominent acts of the people, that
it is impossible to proceed far with the one without falling into
the company of the other.&nbsp; A few facts may serve to
illustrate this point.</p>
<p>We (Alcibiade and I) are here duly received into the
employment of Herr Stickl, Jeweller to the Court.&nbsp; This may
appear a matter of no importance to any but ourselves;
nevertheless the &ldquo;Herr&rdquo; is bound duly to notify the
circumstance to the police, with date and certification, and must
also instruct the Forsteher, or chief of the Guild of goldsmiths
and jewellers, of the matter, that we may be properly registered
by corporation and police.&nbsp; This is item number one.&nbsp;
But I am still unhoused, and here my good friend and
fellow-workman, Alcibiade Tourniquet, native of Argenteuil,
stands me in good stead.&nbsp; Tourniquet claims to be a
Parisian, and has lofty notions about style and
appearances.&nbsp; He lives in Jerusalem Strasse in a grand
house, with a <i>porte coch&egrave;re</i>, and a wide, scrambling
staircase.&nbsp; He offers me a share in his apartment, which is
light and commodious; and as his landlady generously consents to
provide an additional bed for my accommodation, on condition of
doubling the rent, that matter is satisfactorily arranged.&nbsp;
Alcibiade has experiences to relate, and this is one of them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pense donc!&rdquo; cries he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I arrive in
Berlin a perfect stranger.&nbsp; Without work and without
friends, I find living at an hotel too expensive: Bon!&mdash;I
look about me for some quiet little chambre <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>garni, and
finding one to my liking, up a great many stairs, genteelly
furnished, and not too dear, I move myself and my little baggage
into it without further inquiry.&nbsp; Bon!&nbsp; Imagine me on
the first night of residence, snugly coiled up between my two
feather beds in true German fashion, dreaming of la belle France,
and of the grapes at Argenteuil, when rap, rap, rap! comes a
tantamarre at the chamber door, and I start up wide awake all at
once, and hear a shuffling noise outside, and a rough voice which
calls to be admitted.&nbsp; &lsquo;Diable! qu&rsquo;est que tu
veux, donc?&rsquo; I inquire.&nbsp; But before I can make up my
mind whether to admit them or not, crack! goes the door, and half
a dozen Prussian police take my citadel by storm, and surround me
in a moment.&nbsp; I complain indignantly, but it is of no
use.&nbsp; I hurl at them&mdash;not my boots&mdash;but all the
hard words I know of in their own abominable language, together
with a considerable quantity of good French, but all of no avail;
for they make me dress myself and carry me off bodily with bag
and baggage to the police-bureau.&nbsp; And what was it all
about, pense tu?&nbsp; Just this: they said I had got into a
suspected house, and that it was for my own protection I was made
a prisoner of!&nbsp; Nom de Dieu! that might be all very well,
but there was no necessity to pull me out of bed to take care of
me; and it was not till I had shown that my papers were all <i>en
regle</i>, and threatened an appeal to the French Ambassador,
that they gave me these soft words, and expressed their regret at
my discomfiture.&nbsp; Du reste, what can you expect? they are
only Prussians.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is item number two.</p>
<p>I too have a little experience of the Prussian Police; let me
relate it.&nbsp; Being regularly domiciled, it was necessary that
I should inform them of my residence.&nbsp; I stand within the
dingy little bureau, and hand over a certificate from my landlord
in proof of my place of habitation.&nbsp; The liveried
functionary casts it back to me, with the curt remark, &ldquo;It
is imperfect, the year is omitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it is; and
I trudge back to my landlord to have this rather important
omission rectified.&nbsp; Returning, in haste, I re-present my
document, corrected and revised, for inspection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; exclaims the irate registrar
of apartments; &ldquo;the day of the week should be
mentioned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dull-headed landlord! unlucky
lodger!&mdash;it should have been written,
&ldquo;<i>Wednesday</i>, the 19th of,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; This
looks something like quibbling, however, and no doubt I express
as much by my countenance as I leave the bureau, and race back to
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Jerusalem Strasse once more.&nbsp; For the third time I
offer my credentials.&nbsp; &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; observes
the official, with a ferocious calmness, &ldquo;but I must have a
duplicate of this, for the convenience of entry and
reference.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, by all the gilded buttons on the
best coat of the British Ambassador, this is too bad! and I say
as much.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have nothing of this sort in England, I
suppose?&rdquo; sneers the clerk-policeman.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
thank Heaven!&rdquo; I exclaim, as I rush home once more to
obtain the copy of my certificate.&nbsp; This is item the
third.&nbsp; To a Prussian, all this is a mere matter of course,
yet to such a degree does this home interference extend, that the
<i>porte coch&egrave;re</i> of our grand house, and the door of
every other house in Jerusalem Strasse, is officially closed at
nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening; and no man can enter his own
residence after that hour without first applying to the
police-watchman, who retains in his keeping, literally and in
fact, the &ldquo;key of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While on my way to Berlin, I had been frequently warned by
Germans, natives of other states, of the boastful and deceptive
character of the Prussians.&nbsp; Such was the general opinion
expressed; and although I never found them deceptive, the epithet
of boastful seemed only too truthfully bestowed.&nbsp; A Prussian
is naturally a swaggerer; but then, unfortunately for other
Germans, who are swaggerers too, the Prussian has something to
boast of.&nbsp; He feels and thinks differently to those around
him; for, by the very impetus of his nature, he stands on a
higher position.&nbsp; It is because Prussia has progressed like
a giant, while the rest of Germany has been lagging behind, or
actually losing ground, that every individual in her now large
area seems personally to have aided in the work, and acts and
speaks as if the whole ultimate result depended upon his own
exertions.&nbsp; This naturally leads to exaggeration, both in
words and actions, and your true Berliner figures as a sort of
Ancient Pistol, with more words than he knows properly what to do
with, and more pretensions than he is able to maintain.&nbsp; One
striking characteristic of the people of Berlin is the
Franco-mania, which prevails among all classes.&nbsp; This may be
the result of the decided leaning towards France and its
literature, which was evinced by their almost idolised king,
Frederick the Great; but one would think that the events of the
last war with Napoleon must have effectually obliterated
that.&nbsp; But, no; in their language, their literature, their
places of public amusement, their shops, and promenades, French
words sound in your ears, or meet your eye at every <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>turn;
while the sometimes ridiculous mimicry of French habits forces
itself upon your attention.&nbsp; There would be nothing so very
remarkable in this, if the opinion generally expressed of the
French people were consonant with it; but while the Berliner apes
the Parisian in language and manners, he never fails to express
his derision, and even contempt, for the whole French nation on
every convenient opportunity.&nbsp; I suspect, however, that
these remarks might not inaptly apply to the inhabitants of the
British capital, as well as those of Berlin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will the Herrn Tourniquet and Tuci,&rdquo; said the
Frau Kupferkram one morning, with a duck and a smirk, &ldquo;do
us the honour of supping with us this evening?&nbsp; There will
be a few friends, for this is the &lsquo;nahmenstag&rsquo; of our
dear Gottlob, now in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liebe Frau Kupferkram, we shall be
delighted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ought, perhaps, to observe, that in Prussia, although a
Protestant country, the Catholic custom of commemorating the
&ldquo;saint&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;birth-day,&rdquo; is
almost universal.&nbsp; The former is called the
&ldquo;nahmenstag,&rdquo; or name-day.</p>
<p>But the day is yet &ldquo;so young,&rdquo; that nothing short
of the most inveterate gluttony could bend the mind at present
upon the evening&rsquo;s festivity; and moreover, the Berlin
races have called us from the workshop and the cares of labour,
and our very souls are in the stirrups, eagerly panting for the
sport.&nbsp; My dear reader, how can I describe what I never
saw?&nbsp; Did we not expend two silver groschens in a programme
of the races, and gloat over the spirited <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>engraving of
a &ldquo;flying&rdquo; something, which was its appropriate
heading, and which you would swear was executed somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Holywell Street, Strand?&nbsp; Did we not grow
hotter than even the hot sun could make us, in ploughing through
the sand, and commit some careless uncivilities in struggling
among the crowd that hemmed the course as with a wall?&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; Nobody at the Berlin races ever
does see anything but the mounted police and the dust.&nbsp; Yes,
sir, lay out two dollars in a &ldquo;card&rdquo; for the grand
stand, and fix it in your hat-band like a turnpike ticket, and
you may saunter through the whole police-military cordon; but be
one of the crowd, and trust to no other aid than is afforded by
your own eyes, and the said cordon will be the extent of your
vision.</p>
<p>A fig for the races! we will go and see the Kreutzberg
instead.&nbsp; Our way lies through the Halle gate&mdash;Halle, a
town that belonged to the Saxons before the French invasion, but
lost through their adherence to Napoleon, is now the seat of a
Prussian university&mdash;and by the Place of the Belle
Alliance.&nbsp; What &ldquo;alliance?&rdquo;&nbsp; The alliance
of sovereigns against destruction, or of people against
tyranny?&nbsp; One and both; but while the union of the former
has triumphed over the common leveller, the latter, by whose aid
it was effected, still drag their unrelenting chains.&nbsp; The
Kreutzberg is consecrated to the same magniloquent union, and
bears upon its head a military monument illustrative of the
triumph of a roused and indignant people against a great
oppression; but alas! it does not record the emancipation of that
same people from intestine slavery.&nbsp; But that is their
business and not ours.</p>
<p>The Kreutzberg stands about a mile and a half from the city
gates, and rears its grey height like a mountain amid the general
level, commanding a prospect of thirty miles around.&nbsp;
Berlin, half garden, half palace, lies at your feet, rising
majestically from the sandy plain, and irregularly divided by the
winding Spree.&nbsp; The surrounding country, by its luxuriance,
gives evidence of the energy of an industrious race struggling
against a naturally barren soil.&nbsp; Turning our eyes upwards
upon the military monument which graces the summit of the hill,
we cannot repress our gratification at its beauty.&nbsp; A
terrace eighty feet in diameter rises from the bare ground, and
in its centre, upon a substructure of stone, towers an iron
temple or shrine in the turreted Gothic style, divided into
twelve chapels or niches.&nbsp; In each recess stands a figure,
life size, <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>emblematical of the principal battles
(defeats included) fought in the campaigns of 1813, 1814, and
1815.&nbsp; A noble cluster of idealised military heroism they
stand; some in the stubborn attitude of resistance, others in the
eager impetuosity of attack, all wonderfully spirited.&nbsp; When
you have warmed your imagination into a glow by the sight of
these effigies of war, read and ponder over this
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sovereign to his People, who at his summons
magnanimously poured forth their Blood and Treasure for the
Country.&nbsp; In Memory of the Fallen, in Gratitude to the
Living, as an Incitement to every future Generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One is tempted to add, &ldquo;and of sacred promises still
unfulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a beautiful garden and saloon
called the Tivoli, close at hand, and from our heroics we soon
slide into the peaceful enjoyment of a &ldquo;baisser&rdquo; and
a cup of coffee; lounging luxuriantly among the flowers till the
hour approaches for our departure.</p>
<p>We are a snug little party of a dozen, not including Herr
Kupferkram and the Frau, who will insist upon waiting on
us.&nbsp; There is the smug master-butcher from round the corner,
who has a very becoming sense of his own position in society; two
mild-spoken bookseller&rsquo;s clerks, who scarcely find their
voices till the evening is far advanced; my friend and
fellow-tramp the glovemaker; a spruce little model of a man, with
the crispest hair, and the fullest and best trimmed moustache in
the world, and who is no doubt a great man somewhere; a
tremendous fellow of a student, who talks of cannon-boots,
rapiers, and Berliner Weiss Bier; and an individual whose only
distinguishing feature is his nose, and that is an insult to
polite society.&nbsp; The rest have no characteristics at
all.</p>
<p>But ah! shall I forget thee, the beautiful Louise!&mdash;the
affianced of Gottlob, the blonde, the coquettish, and the
gay!&nbsp; Have you not asked me, in half confidence (Alcibiade
being present), whether the German &ldquo;<i>geliebte</i>,&rdquo;
is not changed in English into &ldquo;<i>s&uuml;sses
herz</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweet-heart,&rdquo; as Gottlob had told
you in his last letter from London?&nbsp; And you think the
sentiment &ldquo;so pretty and poetical!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it
is; but we dunderheads in England have used the word so often
that we have half forgotten its meaning.</p>
<p>Down we sit to supper; commencing with a delicate gravy soup
and liver fritters; following up with breaded pork-chops and red
saurkraut; continuing upon baked veal and prunes; not forgetting
the <i>entremets</i> of green pease and finely-sliced carrots
stewed in <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>butter together; going on with a
well-made sallad; and winding up with a syllabub and
preserves.&nbsp; Hah!&nbsp; Bread unlimited, and beer without
discretion.&nbsp; How can we sing after all that and yet we do,
and talk unceasingly.&nbsp; The tables are cleared; and,
accompanied by a beautiful tinkling of tiny bell-shaped glasses,
the china punch-bowl, odorous with its steaming orange fluid, is
placed at the head of the table.&nbsp; How the meek
bookseller&rsquo;s clerks shine out!&nbsp; They are all voice
now.&nbsp; And we drink a &ldquo;Lebe hoch!&rdquo; to Gottlob far
away; and to Gottlob&rsquo;s mother, and to Gottlob&rsquo;s
father, chinking our glasses merrily every time, and draining
them after each draught on our thumb nails, to show how
faithfully we have honoured the toasts.&nbsp; We shout
&ldquo;Vivat h-o-o-o;&rdquo; till the old German oven quakes
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing, fair Louise, I prithee sing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Louise
is troubled with a cold, of course; and, after due persuasion,
lisps and murmurs some incoherent tremblings; exceedingly pretty,
no doubt, if we could only make out what they meant.&nbsp; Then
the student, who, although diminutive, has the voice of a giant,
shouts a university song with the Latin chorus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Edite, bebite, collegiales,<br />
Post multa s&aelig;cula procula nulla!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Eat ye then, drink ye then, social
companions,<br />
Centuries hence and your cups are no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mildest of the clerks comes out well with Kotzebue&rsquo;s
philosophical song:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Es kann ja nicht immer so bleiben,<br />
Hier unter den wechselnden Mond;<br />
Es bl&uuml;ht eine Zeit und verwelket,<br />
Was mit uns die Erde bewhont.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;It cannot remain thus for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here under the changeable moon;<br />
For earthly things bloom but a season,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wither away all too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spruce gentleman with the crisp hair throws back his head,
and with closed eyes warbles melodiously:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Einsich bin ich nicht allein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone I&rsquo;m not in solitude.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>The butcher has forgotten his dignity, and joins
vigorously in every chorus.&nbsp; At this crisis Louise
gracefully retires, leaving us to our replenished bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends!&rdquo; shouts the student, mounting on a
chair, &ldquo;listen to me for a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he
plunges into an eloquent discourse upon the beauties of
fraternity, and the union of nations, concluding his harangue by
proposing a &ldquo;Lebe hoch&rdquo; to Alcibiade and
myself.&nbsp; Alcibiade is decidedly the lion of the evening, and
bears his honours gracefully, like a well-tamed creature.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Se sollen leben!&nbsp; Vivat ho&mdash;o!&rdquo; it roars
in our ears, and amid its echoes we duly acknowledge the
compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; exclaims the student,
whose name, by the bye, is Pimblebeck.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now grant
me one other favour.&nbsp; Thou Briton, and thou son of France,
let us drink brotherhood together.&nbsp; What say ye?&nbsp; Let
it be no longer &lsquo;you&rsquo; and &lsquo;yours&rsquo; between
us, but &lsquo;thou&rsquo; and &lsquo;thine.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Having reached the affectionate stage of exhilaration, we enter
at once into the spirit of the proposal, and each in his turn,
glass in hand, locking his arm in that of the enthusiastic
Pimblebeck, drinks eternal friendship: to love truly; to defend
valiantly; and to address each other by no other title than that
of &ldquo;thou&rdquo; and &ldquo;thee&rdquo; for the rest of our
lives.</p>
<p>I confess to a certain obliviousness here; a mental haze, amid
which the mingled airs of &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Marsellaise&rdquo; float indistinctly.&nbsp; But above
all, and through all, with terrible distinctness, tones the voice
of Pimblebeck; his boyish form dilated into the dimensions of a
Goliath, as he pours forth the words of a Prussian revolutionary
song, some few of which stand out in letters of fire in my memory
still, thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Prinzen vom Land hinaus,<br />
Denn kommt der B&uuml;rger Schmaus;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aristokraten<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Werden gebraten;<br />
F&uuml;rsten and Pfaffen die werden gehangt!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Drive out the prince and priest,<br />
Then comes the burger&rsquo;s feast;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each aristocrat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall broil in his fat,<br />
And nobles and bigoted bishops be hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">fair time at
leipsic</span>.</p>
<p>From Berlin to Leipsic by rail, in an open carriage, is not
the most interesting journey in the world.&nbsp; Whirr, whizz,
burr! away we hum through the keen Spring air, between pleasant
banks and dark fir-woods, not very rapidly indeed, for we travel
under government regulations, but pleasantly enough if it were
not for the sparks and the dust.&nbsp; There are few objects of
interest on our route, till we perceive the towers of Wittenberg
rising out of the hollow on the left, and we are at once buried
in a dream about the simple monk of Eisleben, who, in his
struggle against the papal authority, grew into the gigantic
proportions of a Luther.</p>
<p>At K&ouml;then we change carriages, for we are on the Saxon
frontier.&nbsp; With a snort and a roar, we start upon our
journey over the dull waste, which can be described in no better
way than by the single word repeated: sand, sand, sand.&nbsp; And
now it comes on to rain, and my thin blouse is but a sorry shred
to withstand the cold, dead drizzle.&nbsp; By degrees the heavy
night clouds wrap themselves round us, fold by fold, till we see
the engine fire reflected on the ground like a flying meteor; and
the forms of lonely trees on the roadside come upon us suddenly,
like spectres out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a lodging for the night, friend?&rdquo;
inquires a kind voice near me, speaking to my very thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I am a stranger in Leipsic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your herberge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inquirer is a little man with a thin face, and a voice
which might be disagreeable, were it not mellowed by good
nature.&nbsp; He tells me, then, that he is a jewel-case maker,
and has no doubt that I shall find a ready shelter in the
herberge of his trade till the morning, if I am willing to accept
of it.&nbsp; It is in the Little Churchyard.&nbsp; In spite of
this ominous direction I shake the good man heartily by the hand,
and, although I lose him in the darkness and confusion of the
railway-station, cling mentally to the Little Churchyard as a
passport <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>to peace and rest.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know how it is that I escape interrogation by the
police, but once out of the turmoil of the crowd, I find myself
wandering by a deep ditch and the shadowy outline of a high wall,
seeking in vain amid the drizzling mist for one of the gates of
the city.&nbsp; When almost hopeless of success, a welcome voice
inquires my destination; and, under the guidance of a worthy
Saxon, I find myself in Kleine Kirche Hof at last.&nbsp; There is
the herberge in question, but with no light&mdash;welcoming
sign!&mdash;for it is already ten o&rsquo;clock, and its guests
are all in bed.&nbsp; Dripping with rain, and with a rueful
aspect, I prefer my request for a lodging.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;vater&rdquo; looks dubiously at me out of the corner of
one eye, till, having inspected my passport, he brightens up a
little, and thinks he can find me a bed, but cannot break through
the rules of his house so far as to give me any supper.&nbsp; It
is too late.</p>
<p>Lighting a small lantern he leads the way across a stone-paved
yard, and, opening one leaf of the folding-doors of a stable at
its upper end, inducts me at once into the interior.&nbsp; It
also is paved with stones, is small, and is nearly choked up with
five or six bedsteads.&nbsp; The vater points to one which
happily is as yet untenanted, and says, &ldquo;Now, make haste,
will you?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t stop here all night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Before I have time to scramble into bed we are already in
darkness, and no sooner is the door closed than my bed-fellows,
who seemed all fast asleep a moment before, open a rattling fire
of inquiries as to my parentage, birthplace, trade, and general
condition; and having satisfied all this amiable questioning we
fall asleep.</p>
<p>We turn our waking eyes upon a miserable glimmering which
finds its way through the wooden bars of our stable-door; but it
tells us of morning, of life, and of hope, and we rise with a
bound, and are as brisk as bees in our summary toilet.&nbsp; With
a dry crust of bread and a cup of coffee, we are fortified for
our morning&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I have a letter of introduction
upon Herr Herzlich of the Br&uuml;hl, at the sign of the Golden
Horn, between the White Lamb and the Brass Candlestick.&nbsp;
Every house in Leipsic has its sign, and the numbers run
uninterruptedly through the whole city, as in most German towns;
so that the clown&rsquo;s old joke of &ldquo;Number One,
London,&rdquo; if applied to them, would be no joke at all.</p>
<p>I leave the gloomy precincts of Little Churchyard, and
descending a slight incline over a pebbly, irregular pavement,
with scarcely a sign of footpath, arrive at the lower end of the
Br&uuml;hl.&nbsp; There is a murmur of business about the place,
for this <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>is the first week of the Easter Fair,
but there are none of those common sounds usually associated with
the name to English ears.&nbsp; No braying of trumpets, clashing
of cymbals, or hoarse groaning of gongs; no roaring through
broad-mouthed horns, smacking of canvass, or pattering of
incompetent rifles.&nbsp; All these vulgar noises belonging to a
fair, are banished out of the gates of the city: which is itself
deeply occupied with sober, earnest trading.</p>
<p>Leipsic has the privilege of holding three markets in the
year.&nbsp; The first, because the most important, is called the
Ostermesse, or Easter Fair, and commences on Jubilee Sunday after
Easter.&nbsp; It continues for three weeks, and is the great
cloth market of the year.&nbsp; The second begins on the Sunday
after St. Michael, and is called Michialismesse.&nbsp; It is the
great Book Fair, is also of three weeks&rsquo; duration, and
dates, as does the Easter Fair, from the end of the twelfth
century.&nbsp; The New Year&rsquo;s Fair commences on the First
of January, and was established in fourteen hundred and
fifty-eight.&nbsp; Curiously enough, the real business of the
Fair is negotiated in the week preceding its actual proclamation;
it is then that the great sales between manufacturers and
merchants, and their busy agents from all parts of the continent,
are effected, while the three weeks of the actual Fair are taken
up in minor transactions.&nbsp; No sooner is the freedom of the
Fair proclaimed than the hubbub begins; the booths, already
planted in their allotted spaces&mdash;every inch of which must
be paid for&mdash;are found to be choked up with stock of every
description, from very distant countries: while every town and
village, within a wide radius, finds itself represented by both
wares and customers.</p>
<p>It is not, however, all freedom even at fair time.&nbsp; The
guild laws of the different trades, exclusive and jealous as they
are, are enforced with the utmost severity.&nbsp; Jews, in
general, and certain trades in particular,&mdash;shoemakers, for
example,&mdash;are not allowed the same privileges as the rest;
for their liberty to sell is restricted to a shorter period, and
woe to the ambitious or unhappy journeyman who shall manufacture,
or expose for sale, any article of his trade, either on his own
account or for others, if they be not acknowledged as masters by
the Guild.&nbsp; Every such article will be seized by the public
officers, deposited in the Rathhaus, and severe
punishment&mdash;in the shape of fines&mdash;inflicted on the
offender.&nbsp; The last week of the Fair is called the pay-week;
the Thursday and Friday in this week being severally pay and
assignation days.&nbsp; The traffic at the Easter <!-- page
73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Fair,
before the establishment of railways, was estimated at forty
millions of dollars, but since, by their means, increased
facilities of transit between Leipsic and the two capitals,
Berlin and Dresden, have been afforded, it has risen to seventy
millions of dollars, or ten millions five hundred thousand pounds
sterling.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here we are in the Br&uuml;hl, a street
important enough, no doubt, so far as its inhabitants and traffic
are concerned, but neither beautiful nor picturesque.&nbsp; The
houses are high and flat, and, from a peculiarity of build about
their tops, seem to leer at you with one eye.&nbsp; Softly over
the pebbles! and mind you don&rsquo;t tread on the pigeons.&nbsp;
They are the only creatures in Leipsic that enjoy uncontrolled
freedom.&nbsp; They wriggle about the streets without fear of
molestation; they sit in rows upon the tops of houses; they whirl
in little clouds above our heads; they outnumber, at a moderate
estimate, the whole human population of the city, and are as
sacred as the Apis or the Brahmin bull.&nbsp; As we proceed along
the Br&uuml;hl, the evidences of the traffic become more
perceptible.&nbsp; Square sheds of a dingy black hue line one
side of the way, and are made in such a manner, that from being
more closed boxes at night, they readily become converted into
shops in the daytime, by a falling flap in front, which in some
cases is adjusted so as to perform the part of a counter.&nbsp;
These booths form the outer depositories of the merchandise of
the fair, and are generally filled with small and inexpensive
articles.&nbsp; The real riches accumulated in Leipsic during
these periods, are stowed in the massive old houses: floor above
floor being filled with them, till they jam up the very roof, and
their plenitude flow out into the street.&nbsp; The booths, where
not private property, are articles of profitable speculation with
the master builders of the city.&nbsp; They are of planed deal
painted, and are neatly enough made.&nbsp; They are easily stowed
away in ordinary times, and, when required, are readily erected,
being simply clammed together with huge hooks and eyes.</p>
<p>We have not proceeded half-way down the Br&uuml;hl, when we
are accosted by a veritable child of Israel, who in tolerably
good English requests our custom.&nbsp; Will we buy some of those
unexceptionable slippers?&nbsp; In spite of my cap and blouse, it
is evident that I bear some national peculiarity about me, at
once readable to the keen eyes of the Jew; and upon this point, I
remember that my friend Alcibiade, of Argenteuil, jeweller, once
expressed himself to me thus: &ldquo;You may always distinguish
an Englishman,&rdquo; said he, <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>&ldquo;by two
things: his trousers and his gait.&nbsp; The first never fit him,
and he always walks as if he was an hour behind time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are at the sign of the Golden Horn.&nbsp; Its very door-way
is blocked up for the moment by an enormous bale of goods, puffy,
and covered with cabalistic characters.&nbsp; When we at length
enter the outer gate of the house, we find ourselves in a small
court-yard paved with stone and open to the sky, but now choked
with boxes and packages, piled one upon the other in such
confusion, that they appear to have been rained from above,
rather than brought by vulgar trucks and human hands.&nbsp; Herr
Herzlich, whose house this is, resides on the third floor.&nbsp;
As we ascend the winding stair to his apartments, we perceive
that the building occupies the four sides of the courtyard, and
that on the third floor a wooden gallery is suspended along one
side, and serves as a means of connection between the upper
portions of the house.&nbsp; Queerly-shaped bundles, and even
loose goods, occupy every available corner; and as we look down
from the gallery into a deep window on the opposite side, we
perceive a portly, moustachioed gentleman busily counting and
arranging piles of Prussian bank-notes, while heaps of golden
coin, apparently Dutch ducats, or French louis d&rsquo;or, are
built up in a golden barricade before him.&nbsp; We pause before
the door of Herr Herzlich, master goldsmith and house-owner, and
prepare to deliver our letter of introduction.&nbsp; They are
trying moments, these first self-presentations; but Herr Herzlich
is a true-hearted old Saxon, who raises his black velvet skullcap
with one hand, as I announce myself, while with the other he
lowers his silver spectacles from his forehead on to his
nose.&nbsp; Then, with all sorts of comforting words, as to my
future prospects in Leipsic, he sends me forth rejoicing.</p>
<p>Once more in the open street, we pass up the crowded way into
the market-place.&nbsp; A succession of wooden booths lines the
road; and many of the houses have an overhanging floor resting on
sturdy posts, which makes the footpath a rude colonnade.&nbsp;
Here are piled rolls and bales of cloth, while the booths are
crammed with a heterogeneous collection of articles of use and
ornament diversified beyond description.&nbsp; A strange knot of
gentlemen arrests our attention for a moment.&nbsp; They are clad
in long gowns of black serge, and wear highly-polished boots
reaching to the knee.&nbsp; Some have low-crowned hats, others a
kind of semi-furred turban, but they all have jet black hair
arranged in innumerable wiry ringlets, even to their <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>beards.&nbsp; They are Polish Jews, and trade chiefly in
pearls, garnets, turquoises, and a peculiar sort of ill-cut and
discoloured rose-diamonds.</p>
<p>The market-place is scarcely passable for the crowd, and the
wooden booths are so thickly studded over its whole space, as to
allow of only a narrow footway between them.&nbsp; Here we see
pipes and walking-sticks, enough not only for the present, but
for generations unborn.&nbsp; Traversing the ground by slow
degrees, we bend towards the Dresden gate, and come upon the
country people, all handkerchief and waistcoat, who line the path
with their little stores of toys, of eggs, butter, and little
pats of goats&rsquo;-milk cheese.&nbsp; Here is a farmer who has
straggled all the way from Altenburg.&nbsp; He wears a queer
round-crowned hat, with the rim turned up at the back; a jacket
with large pockets outside, a sort of trunk hose, and black boots
reaching to the knee.&nbsp; A little beyond him is a band of
musicians with wind instruments, in the full costume of the
Berg-leute, or mountaineers of Freiberg.&nbsp; With their jackets
of black stuff, trimmed with velvet of the same hue, and edged at
the bottom with little square lappets; their dark leggings and
brimless hats, they look like a party of Grindoff the
miller&rsquo;s men in mourning.</p>
<p>As we approach the gates, the stalls and wares dwindle into
insignificance, until they disappear altogether; and so we pass
out of the city to the picturesque promenades which surround
it.&nbsp; Afar off we hear the booming and occasional squeal of
the real Fair.&nbsp; It is not without its drollery, and, if not
equal to &ldquo;Old Bartlemy&rdquo; in noise and rude humour, has
a word to say for itself on the point of decency.&nbsp; It is,
however, but child&rsquo;s play after all, and abounds with toys
and games, from a half-penny whistle to an electric
machine.&nbsp; Leipsic is now in its waking hours; but a short
time hence her fitful three weeks&rsquo; fever will have passed
away, and, weary with excitement, or as some say, plethoric with
her gorge of profits, she will sink into a soulless
lethargy.&nbsp; Her streets will become deserted, and echo to
solitary footsteps; and whole rows of houses, with their lately
teeming shops, will be black and tenantless, and barred and
locked in grim security.&nbsp; The students will shine among the
quiet citizens; the pigeons will flap their wings in idleness,
and coo in melancholy tones as they totter about the streets; and
the last itinerant player (on the flageolet, of course) will have
sounded his farewell note to the slumbering city.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">down in a silver
mine</span>.</p>
<p>The sojourner in Leipsic, while strolling through its quaint
old streets and spacious market-place, will be attracted, among
other peculiarities of national costume, by one which, while
startling and showy, is still attractive and picturesque.&nbsp;
The wearer is most probably a young man of small figure and of
pallid appearance.&nbsp; He is dressed in a short jacket, which
is black, and is enriched with black velvet.&nbsp; The nether
garments are also black.&nbsp; His head is covered with a black
brimless hat, and a small semicircular apron of dark cloth is
tied, not before, but behind.&nbsp; This is one of the
Berg-leute, mountain people; he comes from the Freiberg silver
district, and is attired in the full dress of a miner.</p>
<p>Doubtless, these somewhat theatrically attired mountaineers
hold a superior position to the diggers and blasters of the
earth.&nbsp; The dress is, perhaps, more properly that worn in
the mountains, than that of the miners themselves.&nbsp; Still,
even their habiliments, as I afterwards learned, are but a
working-day copy of this more costly model; and the semicircular
apron tied on behind, is more especially an indispensable portion
of the working dress of the labouring miner.</p>
<p>From Leipsic, the mines are distant about seventy English
miles.&nbsp; We&mdash;who are a happy party of foot-wanderers
bound for Vienna&mdash;spend three careless days upon the
road.&nbsp; Look at this glorious old castle of Altenburg,
gravely nodding from its towering rock upon the quaint town
below.&nbsp; It is the first station we come to, and is the
capital of the ancient dukedom of Saxon-Altenburg.&nbsp; Look at
the people about us!&nbsp; Does it not strike you as original,
that what is here called modest attire, would elsewhere be
condemned as immoral and ridiculous?&nbsp; Each of the males,
indeed, presents an old German portrait, with short plaited and
wadded jacket, trunk breeches, and low hat, with a rolled
brim.&nbsp; But the women!&nbsp; With petticoats no deeper than a
Highlandman&rsquo;s kilt, and their legs thus <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>guiltless of
shoes or stockings, the bust and neck are hideously covered by a
wooden breastplate, which, springing from the waist, rises at an
angle of forty-five degrees as high as the chin; and on the edge
of it is fastened a handkerchief, tied tightly round the
neck.&nbsp; A greater disfigurement of the female form could
scarcely have been devised.&nbsp; Yet, to these good people, it
is doubtless beauty and propriety itself; for it is old, and
national.</p>
<p>Through pretty woods and cultivated lands; beside rugged,
roadside dells, we trudge along.&nbsp; We halt in quiet villages,
snug and neat even in their poverty; or wend our way, in the
midst of sunshine, through endless vistas of fruit-laden woods,
the public road being one rich orchard of red-dotted
cherry-trees: purchasable for a mere fraction, but not to be
feloniously abstracted.&nbsp; Through Altenburg, Zwickau,
Oederon, and Chemnitz; up steep hill paths, and by the side of
unpronounceable villages, until, on the morning of the fourth
day, we straggle into Freiberg.</p>
<p>Freiberg is the walled capital of the Saxon ore mountains, the
Erzgebirge; the centre of the Saxon mining administration.&nbsp;
One of its most spacious buildings is the Mining Academy, which
dates from 1767.&nbsp; Here are rich collections of the wonderful
produce of these mountains; models of mining machines, of
philosophical and chemical apparatus; class and lecture rooms,
and books out of number.&nbsp; Here Werner, the father of
geology, and Humboldt, the systematiser of physical geography,
were pupils.&nbsp; The former has bequeathed an extensive museum
of mineralogy to the Academy, which has been gratefully named
after its founder, the Wernerian Museum.</p>
<p>Freiberg holds up its head very high.&nbsp; The Mining Academy
stands one thousand two hundred and thirty-one feet above the
sea, although this is by no means the greatest altitude in the
long range of mountains, which form a huge boundary line between
the kingdoms of Saxony and Bohemia.&nbsp; The general name for
the whole district is the Erzgebirg-Kreis&mdash;the circle of ore
mountains&mdash;and truly they form one vast store of silver,
tin, lead, iron, coal, copper, and cobalt ores; besides a host of
chemical compounds and other riches.&nbsp; The indefatigable
Saxons have worked and burrowed in them for more than seven
hundred years.</p>
<p>We proceed to the Royal Saxon Mining Office, and request
permission to descend into the &ldquo;bowels of the
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is accorded us without difficulty, and we
receive a beautiful specimen of <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>German text,
in the shape of a lithographed Fahrschein, or permission to
descend into Abraham&rsquo;s Shaft and Himmelfahrt, and to
inspect all the works and appliances thereunto belonging.&nbsp;
This Fahrschein especially informs us, that no person, unless of
the Minerstand (fraternity of miners), can be permitted to
descend into the Zechen or pits, who is not eighteen years old;
nor can more than two persons be intrusted to the care of one
guide.&nbsp; We cheerfully pay on demand the sum of ten silver
groschens each (about one shilling), for the purpose&mdash;as we
are informed in a note at the bottom of the Fahrschein&mdash;of
meeting the exigencies of the Miners&rsquo; Pension and Relief
Fund.</p>
<p>The mine we are about to inspect, which bears the general
title of Himmelsfurst&mdash;Prince of Heaven&mdash;is situated
near to the village of Brand.&nbsp; How fond these old miners
were of Biblical designations! and what an earnest spirit of
religion glowed within them!&nbsp; There is another mine in the
vicinity, at Voightberg, called the Old Hope of God; but we must
recollect that Freiberg was one of the strongholds of early
Protestantism, and that the first and sternest of the reformers
clustered about its mountains.&nbsp; They have a cold, desolate
look; and we think of the gardens we have left at their bases,
and of the forests of fir-trees which wave upon some of the
loftier pinnacles of these same Erzgebirge.&nbsp; Nor are the few
men we meet of more promising appearance: not dwarfed nor
stunted, but naturally diminutive, with sallow skins and
oppressed demeanour.&nbsp; How different are the firm, lithe,
sun-tanned mountaineers, who breathe the free air on the summits
of their hills!</p>
<p>We are near the entrance of the mine; and, entering the neat,
wooden office of the Schachtmeister, or mine-controller, we
produce our credentials.&nbsp; Having signed our names in a huge
book (in which we decipher more than one English name), we are
passed to the care of an intelligent-looking guide; who, although
still in early manhood, is of the same small and delicate growth
observable in the miners generally.</p>
<p>Our guide, providing himself with small lanterns and an
ominous-looking bundle, leads the way out of the
Schachtmeister&rsquo;s office to another portion of the same
building.&nbsp; Here are heaps of dark grey
&ldquo;macadamised&rdquo; stones;&mdash;silver and lead ores just
raised from the pit; over whose very mouth we are unknowingly
standing.&nbsp; A windlass is in the centre of the chasm; and it
is by means of this windlass that the metalliferous substance is
raised to the surface in <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>square wooden
boxes.&nbsp; Here the dressing of the ores commences; boys
cluster in all directions, under the wooden shed, and in oilier
sheds beyond that.&nbsp; Here the ores are picked and sorted,
washed and sieved, and, we believe, crushed or pulverised,
according to the amount of metal contained in them, till they are
in a fit state for the smelting furnace.&nbsp; We are not
admitted to a minute inspection of these processes; but, under
the direction of our guide, turn towards the mouth of the pit
which we are to descend.&nbsp; Ere we leave the shed, we pick out
a small block of ore as a memorial of the visit, and are
astonished at its weight; bright yellow, and dull lead-coloured
crystals gleam over its surface; and a portion of the gneiss,
from which it has been broken, still adheres to it.</p>
<p>We follow our guide across a dusty space towards a wooden
building with a conical roof; and, as we approach it, we become
conscious of, rather than hear, the sweet, melancholy sound of a
bell, which, at minute intervals, tones dreamily through the
air.&nbsp; Whence comes that sad sound?&nbsp; In the centre of
the shed is a square box, open at the top; and immediately above
hangs the small bell; thence comes the silvery voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what purpose is this bell?&rdquo; we inquire of our
guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the bell of safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it sound a warning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the reverse; its silence gives the warning.&nbsp;
The bell is tolled by a large water-wheel, immediately below the
surface.&nbsp; By means of this wheel, and others at greater
depths, the whole drainage of this mine is effected.&nbsp; If, by
any means, these waterwheels should cease to act, the bell would
cease to sound, and the miners would hasten to the day, for no
man could tell how soon his working might be flooded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can it be heard throughout the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this portion of it.&nbsp; Probably the water
acts as a conductor of the sound; but the miners listen earnestly
for its minute tolling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toll on, thou messenger of comfort!&nbsp; May thy voice ever
tell of safety to the haggard toiler, deep in the earth!</p>
<p>Our guide now directs us to attire ourselves in the garments
disgorged from the portentous-looking bundle.&nbsp; They consist
of a pair of black calico trousers, a dark, lapelled coat, a
leathern semicircular apron, buckled on behind&mdash;the strap of
which serves to hook a small lantern on in front&mdash;and a
terrible brimless felt hat, which <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>we feel to be
a curse the moment we put it on, and which we never cease to
anathematise, up to the instant when we take it off.&nbsp; These
habiliments being drawn over our ordinary clothing, do not
facilitate our motions, or help to keep us in so cool a state as
might be desirable.</p>
<p>Over the edge of the square box, and down a stone staircase
cut through the solid granite, we follow our guide.&nbsp; We
pause on the first few steps, and are just able to distinguish
the huge, broad water-wheel, slowly revolving in its stony
chamber: its spokes, like giant arms, sweep through the wet
darkness with scarcely a sound, but a low dripping and gurgling
of water.&nbsp; That terrible staircase! dark and steep and
slimy!&nbsp; Water drips from its roof and oozes from its
walls.&nbsp; It is so low, that instead of bending forward as the
body naturally does when in the act of descent, we are compelled
to throw our heads back at the risk of dislocating our necks, in
order that the detestable hat may not be driven over our eyes by
coming in contact with the roof.&nbsp; Down, down the slippery
steps; feeling our way along slimy walls: through the dense
gloom, and heavy, moist air!&nbsp; The way seems to wave and bend
we scarcely know how; sometimes we traverse level galleries, but
they only lead us again to the steep, clammy steps, cut through
the tough rock, always at the same acute angle.&nbsp; Down, down,
six hundred feet! and our guide whispers to us to be careful how
we go, for we are in a dangerous place: he has brought us to this
portion of the mine to show us how the water accumulates when
undisturbed.</p>
<p>The vein of ore has, in this part, ceased to yield a profit
for the necessary labour, and the works have been
abandoned.&nbsp; We creep breathlessly down until our guide bids
us halt; and, holding out his lantern at arm&rsquo;s length, but
half reveals, in the pitchy darkness, a low-roofed cavern,
floored by an inky lake of still, dead water; in which we see the
light of the lantern reflected as in a mirror.&nbsp; It is
fearful to look on&mdash;so black and motionless: a sluggish
pool, thick and treacherous, which seemingly would engulf us
without so much as a wave or a bubble; and we are within a foot
of its surface!&nbsp; We draw involuntarily back, and creep up
the steep stair to the first level above us.</p>
<p>Along a narrow gallery we proceed for a short space, and then
down again; still down the interminable steps, till our knees
crack with the ever uniform motion, and the hot perspiration
streams from every pore.&nbsp; The air is so thick and heavy,
that we occasionally <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>draw breath with a half gasp; and
still we descend, till we hear the muffled ring of
steel,&mdash;tink, tink, tink,&mdash;immediately near us, and are
suddenly arrested in our downward course by the level ground.</p>
<p>We are in a narrow gallery, considerably loftier than any we
have yet seen; for we can walk about in it without
stooping.&nbsp; At the further end are two miners, just
distinguishable by the tiny glow of their lanterns.&nbsp; From
these proceed the ring of steel&mdash;the muffled tinkling in the
thick air we had heard&mdash;and we see that they are preparing
for a &ldquo;blast.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a long steel rod, or
chisel, they are driving a way into the hard rock (geologists say
there is little else in the Erzebirge than the primitive gneiss
and granite), and thus prepare a deep, narrow chamber, within
which a charge of gunpowder is placed and exploded.&nbsp; The
hard material is rent into a thousand pieces, bringing with it
the ore so indefatigably sought.</p>
<p>With every limb strained and distorted, the miners pursue
their cramping labours, grovelling on the earth.&nbsp; The
drilling or boring they are engaged in is a slow process, and the
choice of a spot, so that the explosion may loosen as much of the
lode and as little of the rock as possible, is of considerable
importance.&nbsp; They cease their labours as we enter, and turn
to look at us.&nbsp; The curse of wealth-digging is upon
them.&nbsp; They, in their stained and disordered costume, seated
on the ground on their semicircular leather aprons (for that is
the obvious use of this portion of the dress, in these moist
regions); we, in our borrowed garments and brimless beavers, with
flushed features and dripping hair.&nbsp; The miners do not wear
the abominable hats, at least &ldquo;beneath the day,&rdquo; that
is, in the mines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the bottom of the mine?&rdquo; we inquire
anxiously.</p>
<p>The guide smiles grimly as he answers, &ldquo;We are little
more than half-way to the bottom; but we can descend no deeper in
this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heaven knows we have no desire!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first working,&rdquo; he continues.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The rest of the mine is much the same as you have already
seen.&nbsp; We have no other means of reaching the workings than
by the stone staircases you have partly descended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the miners&rsquo; hours of work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight hours a day for five days in the week at this
depth,&rdquo; is the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the deeper workings
the hours are fewer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;What is the extent of the mine?&rdquo; we
demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell.&nbsp; There is no miner living who has
traversed them all.&nbsp; The greater portion is out of work, and
spreads for miles under ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the depth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hundred fathoms&mdash;twelve hundred
feet&mdash;the sea level.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Old Hope of God&rsquo;
is sixty feet below the level of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there many mines like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are about two hundred mines in all, with five
hundred and forty pits: in all the mines together there are some
four thousand eight hundred hands, men and boys.&nbsp; This mine
occupies nine hundred of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One dollar a week is a good wage with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One dollar is about three shillings of English money!&nbsp;
This seems small pay, even in cheap Saxony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; we pursue our inquiries, &ldquo;you have no
short time, and are pensioned?&mdash;at least, so says our
Fahrschein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are paid our wages during sickness, and are never
out of work.&nbsp; When we can no longer use the pick, nor climb
these staircases, we can retire upon our pension of eight silver
groschens a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tenpence!&nbsp; Magnificent independence!&nbsp; This is
digging for silver with a vengeance.</p>
<p>But we are faint with fatigue; and, bidding adieu to the two
miners, we gladly agree to our guide&rsquo;s suggestion of
ascending to the happy daylight.&nbsp; Our way is still the same;
although we mount by another shaft, most appropriately named
Himmelfahrt&mdash;the path of heaven; but we clamber up the same
steep steps; feel our way along the same slimy walls, and
occasionally drive our hats over our eyes against the same low,
dripping roof.&nbsp; With scarcely a dry thread about us; our
hair matted and dripping; beads of perspiration streaming down
our faces, we reach the top at last; and thank Heaven, that after
two hours&rsquo; absence deep down among those terrible
&ldquo;diggins,&rdquo; we are permitted once more to feel the
bracing air, and to look upon the glorious light of day.</p>
<p>Our labours, however are not over.&nbsp; Distant rather more
than an English mile from Himmelsf&uuml;rst are the extensive
amalgamation works, the smelting furnaces and refining
ovens.&nbsp; Painfully fatigued <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>as we are, we
cannot resist the temptation of paying them a brief visit.&nbsp;
The road is dusty and desolate; nor are the works themselves
either striking or attractive.&nbsp; An irregular mass of sheds,
brick buildings, and tall chimneys, present themselves.&nbsp; As
we approach them we come upon a &ldquo;sludge
hole&rdquo;&mdash;the bed of a stream running from the dredging
and jigging works; where, by the agency of water, the ore is
relieved of its earthy and other waste matter, and the stream of
water&mdash;allowed to run off in separate
channels&mdash;deposits, as it flows, the smaller particles
washed away in the first process.&nbsp; These are all carefully
collected, and the veriest atom of silver or lead
extracted.&nbsp; It is only the coarser ores that undergo this
process; the richer deposits being pulverised and smelted with
white or charred wood and fluxes, without the application of
water, and refined by amalgamation with quicksilver.&nbsp; The
two metals are afterwards separated by distilling off the
latter.</p>
<p>Here are heaps of scoria&mdash;stacks of piglead, wood, coke,
limestone and waste earth, everything, indeed, but silver;
although we are emphatically in a silver mining district, silver
is by no means the material which presents itself in the greatest
bulk.&nbsp; Having placed ourselves under the direction of one of
the workmen, we are led into some newly built brick buildings,
where force-pumps and other water appliances, erected at great
cost by the Saxon government, are gratefully pointed out to
us.&nbsp; These water-works are equally applicable to the
extinction of fire, as to the preparation of ores.</p>
<p>Into what an incomprehensible maze of words should we be
betrayed, were we to attempt a description of the multifarious
operations for the extraction and refining of metals!&nbsp; Every
description of ore, or metalliferous deposit, requires a
different treatment: each suggested and verified by laborious
experience and vigilant attention.&nbsp; In some cases the pure
silver is separated by mechanical means; in others the ore is
roasted, in order to throw off the sulphur, arsenic, and other
volatile matters, which are separately collected and form no
inconsiderable portion of the valuable produce of the mine.&nbsp;
These roastings again are smelted with a variety of fluxes, and
in different states of purification, until they are ready for
refining.</p>
<p>Here are roasting furnaces, dull and black; huge brick tubes
with swollen ends; others built in, and ready for ignition.&nbsp;
Everywhere, we see pigs of lead, sometimes lying about in
reckless confusion, at others, neatly packed in square
stacks.&nbsp; Now, they bring us to a <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>huge circular
oven, with at least half-a-dozen firmly closed iron doors, and as
many glowing caves; and a swarthy man, armed with an iron rake,
swinging open one of the iron doors with a ring and a clatter, we
look in upon a small lake of molten silver, fuming, and steaming,
and bubbling.&nbsp; The iron rake is thrust in, and scrapes off
the crumbling crust&mdash;the oxide of lead, which has formed
upon its surface.&nbsp; The silver fumes and flashes, and a white
vapour swims in the air.&nbsp; The swarthy man swings the iron
door to with a clang, takes us by the arm, and bids us look
through into a dark cavity, and watch the white drops which fall
at intervals like tiny stars from above.&nbsp; This is the
quicksilver evaporated from the heated silver in the furnace,
which passes through the chimney into a kind of still, and is
restored to its original condition.</p>
<p>And what is the result of all this skill and labour?&nbsp; We
find that the average produce of the Saxon mines is from three to
four ounces of silver to the hundred pounds&rsquo; weight of ore;
and that the mines about Freiberg yield annually nearly four
hundred and fifty thousand ounces of silver.&nbsp; We find
further that the total mines of the
Erzgebirge-Kreis&mdash;&ldquo;circle of ore
mountains&rdquo;&mdash;of which those of Freiberg form a portion,
produce a total of seven hundred and twenty thousand ounces of
silver every year; besides from four hundred to five hundred tons
of lead, one hundred and forty tons of tin, about thirty tons of
copper, from three thousand five hundred to four thousand tons of
iron, and six hundred tons of cobalt.&nbsp; They are rich also in
arsenic, brimstone, and vitriol, and contain, in no
inconsiderable quantities, quicksilver, antimony, calamites,
bismuth, and manganese.&nbsp; Even precious stones are not
wanting; garnets, topazes, tourmalines, amethysts, beryls,
jaspers, and chalcedonies having been found.</p>
<p>A shrewd old workman tells us, with a proud satisfaction, that
when Napoleon&rsquo;s power was crushed, and Saxony had to pay
the penalty of her adhesion to the French conqueror, in the shape
of various parings and loppings of her already narrow
territories&mdash;that Prussia gloated with greedy eyes, and half
stretched out an eager hand to grasp the Erzgebirge and their
mineral riches.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Aber</i>,&rdquo; exclaims he with
a chuckle, &ldquo;<i>die sind noch S&auml;chische</i>, <i>Gott
sey dank</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But they are still Saxon,
thanks be to God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All things considered (the Australian diggins included), we
came to the conclusion, from our small experience of Saxon mines,
that <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>there are more profitable, and even more agreeable
occupations in the world than mining&mdash;pleasanter ways, in
short, of getting a living, than digging for silver in Saxony, or
even for gold in Australia.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">a lift in a
cart</span>.</p>
<p>We left Dresden in the middle of July, a motley group of five:
a Frenchman, an Austrian, two natives of L&uuml;beck, and myself;
silversmiths and jewellers together; all of us duly
<i>vis&eacute;d</i> by our several ambassadors through Saxon
Switzerland, by way of Pirna, on to Peterswald.&nbsp; The latter
is the frontier town of Bohemia, and forms, therefore, the
entrance from Saxony into the Austrian empire.</p>
<p>At dusk we were on the banks of the Elbe, at the ferry station
near Pillnitz, the summer dwelling of the King of Saxony.&nbsp;
Having crossed the broad stream, we leapt joyously up the steep
path that led into a mimic Switzerland; a country of peaks,
valleys, and pine trees, wanting only snow and glaciers.&nbsp;
For three days we wandered among those wild regions; now scaling
the bleak face of a rock; now stretched luxuriously on the purple
moss, or gathering wild raspberries by the road side.&nbsp; From
the abrupt edge of the overhanging Bastei we looked down some six
hundred feet upon the wandering Elbe, threading its way by broad
slopes, rich with the growth of the vine; or by bleached walls of
stone, upon which even the lichens seemed to have been unable to
make good their footing.&nbsp; From the narrow wooden bridge of
Neu Rathen, we looked down upon the waving tops of fir trees,
hundreds of feet beneath us.&nbsp; Then down we ourselves went by
a wild and jagged path into a luxuriant valley called by no unfit
name, Liebethal&mdash;the Valley of Love!</p>
<p>Then there was K&ouml;nigstein, seen far away, a square-topped
mountain, greyish white with time and weather, soaring above the
river&rsquo;s level some fourteen hundred feet.&nbsp; And we
clambered on, never wearying; by mountain fall and sombre cavern,
and round the base of an old rock up to a fortress, till we
reached the iron gates; and, amid the echo of repeated passwords
and the clatter of military arms, entered its gloomy
portal.&nbsp; We entered only to pass through; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and having
admired from the summit a glorious summer prospect, we journeyed
on again into the plains beyond, and so entered the Austrian
territory at Peterswald.</p>
<p>Then there was a great change from fertility to
barrenness.&nbsp; From the moment we entered Bohemia we were
oppressed by a sense of poverty, of sloth, or some worse curse
resulting from Austrian domination, which seemed to have been
enough to cripple even Nature herself as she stood about
us.&nbsp; It was evident that we had got among another race of
people, or else into contact with a quite different state of
things.&nbsp; At the first inn we found upon the road, although
it was a mighty rambling place, with stone staircases and
spacious chambers, there was not bedding enough in the whole
establishment for our party of five, and yet we were the only
guests.&nbsp; We were reduced to the expedient of spreading the
two mattresses at our disposal close together upon the bare
boards, and so sleeping five men in one double bed.&nbsp; A
miserable night we had of it.&nbsp; We fared better at Prague,
which town we entered the next day.&nbsp; That is a fine old
city.&nbsp; From the first glimpse we caught of it from an
adjoining hill, bathing its feet, as it were, in the Moldan, we
were charmed.&nbsp; There was a wonderful cluster of minarets and
conical towers, half Eastern, half German, piled up to the summit
of the castle hill.&nbsp; There was the beautifully barbarous
chapel of Johann von Nepomuk, with its silver tomb.&nbsp; It was
all one mass of picturesque details, beautiful in their outline
and impressive in their very age,&mdash;and, I may add,
dirt.&nbsp; A rare picture of middle-age romance is
Prague&mdash;a fragment of the past, uninjured and
unchanged.&nbsp; The new suspension bridge across the Moldan
looks ridiculous; it is incongruous; what has old Prague to do
with modern engineering?&nbsp; It is a noble structure, to be
sure, of which the inhabitants are proud; but it was designed and
executed for them by an Englishman.</p>
<p>From Prague we tramped with all the diligence of needy
travellers to Br&uuml;nn, the capital of Moravia.&nbsp; Our march
was straggling.&nbsp; Foremost strode Alcibiade Tourniquet,
jeweller and native of Argenteuil, the best fellow in the world:
but one who would persist in marching in a pair of Parisian boots
with high, tapering heels, bearing the pain they gave with little
wincing.&nbsp; For him the ground we trod was classical, for we
were in the neighbourhood of Austerlitz.&nbsp; Immediately in his
rear swaggered the Austrian, with swarthy features and black
straggling locks, swaddled and dirty; he was called
&ldquo;bandit&rdquo; by general consent.&nbsp; The other three
men <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>of our party tramped abreast under the guidance of a
L&uuml;becker, a smart upright fellow, who, on the strength of
having served two years in an infantry regiment, naturally took
the position of drill-sergeant, and was dignified with the name
of Hannibal on that account.</p>
<p>We halted to rest in the village of Bischowitz, where the few
straggling houses, and the dreary, almost tenantless hostelry,
told their own sorrows.&nbsp; But we got good soup, with an
unlimited supply of bread, which formed a dinner of the best
description; for, besides that the adopted doctrine in Germany is
that soup is the best meat for the legs, we found that it also
agreed well with our pockets.&nbsp; While in the full enjoyment
of our rest, we observed that an earnest conversation had sprung
up between the landlord and a ruddy-featured fellow in a green
half-livery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither are you going, friends?&rdquo; inquired the
landlord at length, advancing towards us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to Br&uuml;nn by the high-road,&rdquo; we
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man will carry you beyond Chradim for a
<i>zwanziger</i> a head,&rdquo; said the landlord, pointing to
the half-liveried fellow, who began gesticulating violently, and
marking us off with his fingers as if we were so many
sheep.&nbsp; This was a tempting offer for foot travellers, each
burthened with a heavy knapsack.&nbsp; Chradim was eleven German
miles on our road&mdash;a good fifty miles in English
measurement&mdash;and we were all to be transported this distance
for a total of about three shillings and sixpence.&nbsp; We
therefore inspected the <i>furwerk</i>, which did not promise
much; but as it was drawn by a neat sturdy little horse, who
rattled his harness with a sort of brisk independence that spoke
well for a rapid journey, we readily decided upon the acceptance
of the offer made by the Bohemian driver.&nbsp; That worthy shook
his head when we addressed him, and grunted out &ldquo;<i>Kein
Deutsch</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No German.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed
we found that, excepting people in official situations,
innkeepers, and the like, the German language was either unknown
to, or unacknowledged by the natives.&nbsp; In less than half an
hour we had tumbled our knapsacks into the cart&mdash;which was a
country dray, of course without either springs or seats&mdash;and
disposing ourselves as conveniently as we could on its rough
edges, were rattling and jolting off over the uneven road towards
Collin, our station for the night.</p>
<p>The country through which we passed was uncultivated and
uninteresting; but, like the rest that we had seen, it spoke of a
<!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>poverty rather induced than natural.&nbsp; With the
exception of the two villages of Planinam and B&ouml;hmishbrod we
scarcely saw a house, and human creatures were extremely
scarce.&nbsp; As we approached Collin we halted for a moment to
look at a column of black marble erected on the roadside to
commemorate the devotion of a handful of Russian troops, who had
at this spot checked the progress of the whole French army for
many hours.&nbsp; A little later, and we were lodged at our inn
in the market-town of Collin, where we supped on bread and cheese
and good Prague beer.&nbsp; A wild chorus of loud voices, and an
overwhelming odour of tobacco and onions, were the accompaniments
of our meal.&nbsp; The morrow being market-day in Collin, the
whole population of the district had flocked to the town, and the
houses of accommodation were all full.&nbsp; Our common room was
quite choked up with sturdy forms in white loose coats; broad
country faces, flushed with good humour, or beer, shone upon us
from all sides.&nbsp; Our driver, who had been very sedate and
reserved during the whole of the day, soon joined a cluster of
congenial spirits in one corner, and was the thirstiest and most
uproarious of mortals.&nbsp; As for ourselves, we seemed to be
made doubly strangers, for there was not a word of German spoken
in our hearing.&nbsp; Hours wore on, and the country folks seemed
to enjoy their town excursion so extremely well, that there were
no signs of breaking up, till mine host made his appearance and
insisted upon the lights being put out, and upon the departure of
his guests to bed.&nbsp; But, beds; where were they?&nbsp; Our
military L&uuml;becker laughed at the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are never more than two beds in a Bohemian house
of entertainment,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the landlord by law
claims the best of the two for himself.&nbsp; The other is for
the first comer who pays for it.&nbsp; Perhaps we shall get some
straw, perhaps not.&nbsp; At the worst there are the
boards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we did get some straw, after considerable trouble, and the
whole crowd of boozers (with the exception of our driver, who
went to bed with his horses) set about preparing couches for
themselves, with a tact that plainly showed how well they were
accustomed to it.&nbsp; The straw was spread equally over the
whole chamber, and each man turned over his heavy oaken chair, so
that its back became a pillow.&nbsp; Divested of boots and coats,
we were soon stretched upon our litters, thirty in a room.</p>
<p>Our morning duty was to shake the loose straw out of our hair
and ears, and then to clear away every vestige of our night <!--
page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>accommodation, in order that a delicious breakfast of
rich, black, thick coffee, and plain bread, might be spread
before us in the same room.&nbsp; The country folks were all at
market, and, as far as we could see, so was our driver.&nbsp; He
was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; We had vague notions of his having
decamped; but considering that we had only paid him two
zwanzigers out of the five bargained for, the supposition seemed
hardly a reasonable one.&nbsp; After seeking him in vain through
every room in the house, in the crowded market place, and in the
neat little town, full of low, square-built houses and whitened
colonnades, we thought of the stable, and there we found our
friend, stretched on his back among the hoofs of his horse, who,
careful creature, loving him too well to disturb him, never
stirred a limb.</p>
<p>We saw our guide in a new light that day.&nbsp; In spite of
all our urging, it was nine o&rsquo;clock before we fairly
quitted Collin, and he was then already in an exhilarated state,
having taken several strong draughts to cool his inward
fever.&nbsp; We would have given much to have been able to
converse with him; for, as we were about to start, he grinned and
gesticulated in such a violent way&mdash;having, evidently,
something to communicate which he was unable to
express&mdash;that we called the host to our assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be alarmed,&rdquo; said the landlord in
explanation, &ldquo;if he should swerve from the high-road, for
he thinks of taking you cross country, and it may be a little
rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started at last, and the brave little horse rattled along
at a gallant pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, hi, hi!&rdquo; shouted the
Bohemian, and away we went along the well-beaten high-road,
jolted unmercifully; our knapsacks dancing about our feet like
living creatures.&nbsp; We were too much occupied in the task of
keeping our seats, to be able to devote much attention to the
country, until, having passed Czaslau, we turned suddenly out of
the high-road, and came upon a scene of cultivation and
refinement that was very charming.&nbsp; A rapid cooling down of
our driver&rsquo;s extravagance of manner was the immediate
result of our entering upon the well-kept paths, and between
smooth lawns; we went at a decent trot, following a semicircular
road, by which we were brought immediately in front of a noble
mansion.&nbsp; At the door of an inn, which pressed upon the
pathway, our Bohemian halted and addressed to us a voluble and
enthusiastic harangue in his own language (one that has a soft
and pleasant sound): evidently he meant to impress us with the
beauty of the scene.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>We soon learned all about it from the landlord of the
inn.&nbsp; Our driver was a liveried servant of the Prince before
whose mansion we had stopped, and he was probably running much
risk of dismissal in letting his grace&rsquo;s country cart for
hire.&nbsp; He was a sad dog, for, in the course of a quarter of
an hour he ran up a score upon the strength of an alleged promise
on our parts to pay all expenses, and succeeded in wheedling
another zwanziger in advance out of our cashier, the military
L&uuml;becker.&nbsp; This piece of money, however, on being
proffered in payment of a last half-pint of beer, was instantly
confiscated by the landlord for previous arrears.</p>
<p>Amid a hurricane of abuse, exchanged between landlord and
driver, we clattered out of private ground to the main road
again.&nbsp; Our charioteer had risen into a state of exaltation
that defied all curb, and in a short time we were again firmly
planted before the sign-post of a public-house.&nbsp; But here
there was no credit, and our good-natured L&uuml;becker having
doled out a fourth zwanziger on account, was scarcely surprised
to see it pounced upon and totally appropriated by the host in
liquidation of some ancient score.&nbsp; With a shout of rage, or
rather a howl, from our Bohemian whip, we again set
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hi, hi, hi!&rdquo; and helter-skelter we
went, through bush and bramble, where indeed there was no trace
or shadow of a beaten track.&nbsp; The Bohemian was lost to
control; he shouted, he sang, he yelled, savagely flogging his
willing beast all the while, until we began to have serious fears
for the safety of our necks.&nbsp; Presently we were skimming
along the edge of the steep bank of a broad and rapid stream,
wondering internally what might possibly come next, when, to our
terror, the Bohemian, pointing with his whip to the opposite
bank, suddenly wheeled the horse and rude vehicle round, and
before we could expostulate with or arrest him in his course,
plunged down a long slope and dashed into the river, with a
hissing and splashing that completely blinded us for a few
seconds, and drenched us to the skin.&nbsp; We held on with the
desperation of fear; but before we could well know whether we
swam or rode we had passed the stream, and our unconquered little
horse was tugging us might and main up the opposite bank.&nbsp;
That once obtained, we saw before us a wide expanse of heath,
rugged and broken, and no trace of any road.</p>
<p>But horse and driver seemed to be alike careless about beaten
tracks.&nbsp; The Bohemian grew wilder at every step, urging on
his horse with mad gestures and unearthly cries.&nbsp; His
driving was <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>miraculous; along narrow strips of
road, scarcely wide enough to contain the wheels, he passed in
safety; sometimes skimming the outer ridge of a steep bank, and
when, seemingly about to plunge into an abyss, suddenly wheeling
both horse and cart round at an acute angle, and darting on with
a reckless speed to new dangers and new escapes.&nbsp; We had
been told that he was an admirable hand at the rein when sober;
but, when drunk, he certainly surpassed himself.&nbsp; As for
ourselves, we were in constant fear of our lives; and, being
utterly unacquainted with the country and the language, and
unable to control the extravagances of our driver, we calmly
awaited, and almost invoked, the &ldquo;spill&rdquo; that seemed
inevitable.</p>
<p>But the paroxysm of the Bohemian had reached its height; from
an incarnate devil, in demeanour and language, he rapidly dropped
into childish helplessness, and finally into a deep
uncontrollable slumber.&nbsp; This was a state of things which,
at first, threatened more danger than his open madness; but then
it was the horse&rsquo;s turn to show <i>his</i> quality.&nbsp;
He saw that a responsibility devolved upon him, and he was quite
equal to the occasion.&nbsp; He seemed to know his way as well
without as with his master.&nbsp; We guessed this; and, taking
the reins from the hands of the quite helpless Bohemian, we left
the gallant animal to take whatever course he thought most
prudent.&nbsp; The good beast brought us well out of the tangled
heath, and once more to a level, open road.</p>
<p>Soon, a neat village was before us, and we came to the
resolution that we would dismount there at all hazards.&nbsp; But
then our sleepy driver suddenly started into life, and, with a
terrible outburst of wrath, gave us, by motions, to understand
that we had gone beyond his destination.&nbsp; We paid very
little heed to him; but, leaping from the cart, felt grateful for
the blessing of whole bones.&nbsp; There remained still one
zwanziger unpaid; but, to our astonishment, the Bohemian relapsed
into his old rage when this was tendered to him, and, by a
complication of finger reckoning, explained to us that he had
never received more than two.&nbsp; In fact, he ignored all that
had passed during his drunken fit.&nbsp; Argument being on each
side useless, we also betook ourselves to abuse, and a terrible
conflict of strong language, in which neither party understood
the other, was the result.&nbsp; We entered the chief inn of the
village, followed by the implacable Bohemian, who, though ejected
several times, never failed to re-appear, repeating his finger
calculations every time, and <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>concluding
each assault with the mystical words, &ldquo;<i>Sacramentum
hallaluyah</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord came at length to our
assistance; and, by a few emphatic words in his own language,
exorcised this evil spirit.</p>
<p>We pursued our way by Hohenmauth, and having missed somehow
the larger village of Chradim, lodged for the night in a lonely
hamlet.&nbsp; We walked fully thirty-two miles the next day,
through a wild, neglected country, and hobbled into Loitomischl
as the night was setting in.</p>
<p>We were now upon the borders of Bohemia, and saw glaring on
the wall of a frontier hostelry, &ldquo;Willkommen zu
M&auml;hren&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Welcome to Moravia.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We sealed the welcome by a sumptuous breakfast of sausages and
beer in the frontier town of Zwittau&mdash;a pleasant place, with
a spacious colonnaded market-square&mdash;and finished our meal
on a green bank on the outskirts of the town, with a heap of
sweet blackberries, of which we had purchased a capful for six
kreutzers shein.&nbsp; It was a quiet, beautiful Sunday morning,
and the country folks were streaming towards the church.&nbsp;
They were all in holiday trim, with a strong tendency to
Orientalism in the fashion of their garments.&nbsp; The
women&rsquo;s head-dresses were arranged with much taste,
consisting generally of a large handkerchief, or shawl, folded
turban-wise, with hanging ends; but the heads of the men were
surmounted by an atrocious machine, in the shape of a hat, which,
with its broad, rolled brim, its expanded top, and numerous
braidings and pendants, could be nothing less than an heirloom in
a family.&nbsp; We marched some twenty-five miles that day, and
as the even darkened, entered the village of
Goldentraum&mdash;Golden dream&mdash;happy name! for here, after
four nights of straw-litter, we slept in beds.</p>
<p>Seated in the travellers&rsquo; room was a group which at once
arrested our attention.&nbsp; A swarthy man, with scattered,
raven locks, and a handsome countenance, was filling a glass with
red wine from a round-bellied flask.&nbsp; His companion, a
black, shaggy-bearded fellow, ragged and filthy, sat opposite to
him; while close by the wall, squatted on the ground, was a
squalid, olive-skinned woman, with black, matted hair, who was
vainly endeavouring to still the cries of a child, swaddled at
her back.&nbsp; The men wore slouched Spanish hats, and wide
cloaks, which, partly thrown aside, revealed the rags and dirt
beneath.&nbsp; Bohemian gipseys&mdash;real Bohemians were
they&mdash;filchers and beggars, whose ample cloaks were intended
as much <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>for a convenient means of concealing
stolen property, as articles of dress.&nbsp; Our military
L&uuml;becker thought they would be very useful as a foraging
party.&nbsp; They sat laughing and sipping their wine, now and
then handing a glass of the liquor, in an ungracious way, to the
woman squatted on the ground; and who received it with a real or
assumed humility which was, perhaps, the most curious part of the
picture.&nbsp; Here three of our companions, Alcibiade, the
Viennese silversmith, and one of the L&uuml;beckers, were unable
to proceed further on foot, and took places in the &ldquo;fast
coach;&rdquo; while &ldquo;Hannibal&rdquo; and myself tramped the
remaining twenty miles which lay between us and Br&uuml;nn, the
capital of Moravia.</p>
<p>It was again Sunday, our usual rest day, and I stood in the
open square before the huge church at Br&uuml;nn, watching the
motley, shifting, and clamorous crowd which had converted its
very steps into a market-place.&nbsp; There was something
strikingly Eastern in the character of the women&rsquo;s attire:
intensely gaudy and highly contrasted; and their head-dresses the
very next thing to a turban with double-frilled ends.&nbsp; There
was also something peculiarly Catholic in the nature of the
articles exposed for sale; beads, crosses, coloured pictures of
saints, and tiny images of suffering Saviours; but more
especially in the manner in which the Sunday had been turned into
a market-day.&nbsp; Above all, and through all, the impressive
tones of the solemn chant, mingled with bursts of inspiring
music, pealed out of the open doorway, round which clustered the
kneeling devotees.</p>
<p>Our lame companions started on the following day by rail for
the Austrian capital, while we took the high road.&nbsp; The
country through which we passed was beautifully undulated; hill
and dale following each other in regular succession, and in a far
different state of order and cultivation to the neglected plains
of Bohemia.&nbsp; We were now in Austria proper, and everything
spoke of prosperity and comfort.&nbsp; Neat, populous villages,
hung upon every hill-side&mdash;the southern side
invariably&mdash;and there were no shortcomings in the
accommodation for man or horse.&nbsp; But our finances were in a
miserable plight; and our sustenance during the two and a half
days occupied in tramping the more than eighty miles between
Br&uuml;nn and Vienna, consisted for the most part of fruit,
bread, and water.&nbsp; We crossed the Danube at a place called
&ldquo;Am Spitz,&rdquo; where there is an interminable bridge
across the broad flood, and entered Vienna almost penniless.</p>
<h2><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">the turks&rsquo;
cellar</span>.</p>
<p>You enter the old town of Vienna from Leopoldstadt by the
Ferdinand Bridge; and, walking for a few minutes parallel with
the river, come into a hollow called the Tiefer Grund; passing
next under a broad arch which itself supports a street spanning
the gulley, you find on the left hand a rising ground which must
be climbed in order to reach a certain open space of a triangular
form, walled in by lofty houses, called &ldquo;Die
Freiung,&rdquo;&mdash;the Deliverance.&nbsp; In it there is an
old wine-house, the Turks&rsquo; Cellar, and there belongs to
this spot one of the legends of Vienna.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year sixteen hundred and twenty-seven,
when the city was so closely invested by the Turks, that the
people were half famished, there stood in the place now called
&ldquo;Freiung,&rdquo; or thereabouts, the military bakery for
that portion of the garrison which had its quarters in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The bakery had to supply not only the
soldiers, but bread was made in it to be doled out to destitute
civilians by the municipal authorities; and, as the number of the
destitute was great, the bakers there employed had little
rest.&nbsp; Once in the dead of the night, while some of the
apprentices were getting their dough ready for the early morning
batch, they were alarmed by a hollow ghostly sound as of spirits
knocking in the earth.&nbsp; The blows were regular and quite
distinct, and without cessation until cockcrow.&nbsp; The next
night these awful sounds were again heard, and seemed to become
louder and more urgent as the day drew near; but, with the first
scent of morning air, they suddenly ceased.&nbsp; The apprentices
gave information to the town authorities; a military watch was
set, and the cause of the strange noises in the earth was very
soon discovered.&nbsp; The enemy was under ground; the Turks,
from their camp on the Leopoldiberg, were carrying a mine under
the city; and, not knowing the levels, had approached so nearly
to the surface that there was but a mere crust between them and
the bakehouse floor.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>What was to be done?&nbsp; The danger was
imminent&mdash;the remedy must be prompt and decisive.&nbsp; A
narrow arm of the Danube ran within a hundred yards of the place:
pick and spade were vigorously plied, and in a short time a canal
was cut between the river and the bakery.&nbsp; Little knew the
Turks of the cold water that could then at any time be thrown
upon their undertaking.&nbsp; All was still.&nbsp; The Viennese
say that the hostile troops already filled the mine, armed to the
teeth, and awaiting only a concerted signal to tell them that a
proposed midnight attack on the walls had diverted the attention
of the citizens.&nbsp; Then they were to rush up out of the earth
and surprise the town.&nbsp; But the besieged, forewarned and
forearmed, suddenly threw the flood-gates open and broke a way
for the water through the new canal under the bakehouse floor;
down it went bubbling, hissing, and gurgling into the dark
cavern, where it swept the Mussulmans before it, and destroyed
them to a man.</p>
<p>This was the origin of the Turks&rsquo; Cellar; and although
the title is perhaps unjustly appropriated by the winehouse I
have mentioned, yet there is no doubt that the tale is true, and
that the house at any rate is near the spot from which its name
is taken.&nbsp; Grave citizens even believe that the underground
passage still exists, walled and roofed over with stone, and that
it leads directly to the Turks&rsquo; camp, at the foot of the
Leopoldiberg.&nbsp; They even know the size of it, namely, that
it is of such dimensions as to admit the marching through it of
six men abreast.&nbsp; Of this I know nothing; but I know from
the testimony of a venerable old lady&mdash;who is not the oldest
in Vienna&mdash;that the bakers&rsquo; apprentices were formerly
allowed special privileges in consideration of the service once
rendered by some of their body to the state.&nbsp; Indeed, the
procession of the bakers, on every returning anniversary of the
swamp-in of the Turks, when they marched horse and foot from the
Freiung, with banners, emblems, and music, through the heart of
the city to the grass-grown camp outside the city walls, was one
of the spectacles that made the deepest impression on this chatty
old lady in her childhood.</p>
<p>The Turks&rsquo; Cellar is still famous.&nbsp; It is noted
now, not for its bread or its canal-water, but for its white
wine, its baked veal, and its savoury chickens.&nbsp; Descend
into its depths (for it is truly a cellar and nothing else) late
in the evening, when citizens have time and money at their
disposal, and you find it full of jolly company.&nbsp; As well as
the tobacco-smoke will permit you to see what the place <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>resembles, you would say that it is like nothing so much
as the after cabin of a Gravesend steamer on a summer Sunday
afternoon.&nbsp; There is just such a row of tables on each side;
just such a low roof; just such a thick palpable air, uncertain
light, and noisy steamy crowd of occupants.&nbsp; The place is
intolerable in itself, but fall-to upon the steaming block of
baked veal which is set before you; clear your throat of the
tobacco-smoke by mighty draughts of the pale yellow wine which is
its proper accompaniment; finally, fill a deep-bowled meerschaum
with Three Kings tobacco, creating for yourself your own private
and exclusive atmosphere, and you begin to feel the
situation.&nbsp; The temperature of mine host&rsquo;s cellar aids
imagination greatly in recalling the idea of the old bakehouse,
and there comes over you, after a while, a sense of stifling that
mixes with the nightmare, usually constituting in this place an
after-supper nap.&nbsp; In the waking lethargy that succeeds, you
feel as if jostled in dark vaults by a mob of frantic Turks,
labouring heavily to get breath, and sucking in foul water for
air.</p>
<p>Possibly when fully awakened you begin to consider that the
Turks&rsquo; Cellar is not the most healthful place of recreation
to be in; and, cleaving the dense smoke, you ascend into
sunlight.&nbsp; Perhaps you stroll to some place where the air is
better, but which may still have a story quite as exciting as the
catastrophe of the imperial bakehouse: perhaps to Bertholdsdorf;
a pretty little market-town with a tall-steepled church, and a
half ruined battlement, situated on the hill slope about six
miles to the south of Vienna.&nbsp; It forms a pretty summer
day&rsquo;s ramble.&nbsp; Its chronicler is the worthy
Markt-richter, or Town-justice, Jacob Trinksgeld; and his
unvarnished story, freely translated, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Turkish army, two hundred thousand strong
without their allies, raised the siege of Raab, the retreating
host of rebels and Tartars were sent to overrun the whole of
Austria below the Enns on this side of the Danube, and to waste
it with fire and sword.&nbsp; This was done.&nbsp; On the ninth
of July, detached troops of Spahis and Tartars appeared before
the walls of Bertholdsdorf, but were beaten back by our armed
citizens.&nbsp; Those attacks were repeated on the tenth and
twelfth, and also repulsed; but as at this time the enemy met
with a determined resistance from the city of Vienna, which they
had invested, they gathered in increased force about our devoted
town, and on the fifteenth of July attacked us with such fury on
every side that, seeing it was no longer possible to hold out
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>against them, partly from their great numbers, and
partly from our failing of powder; and, moreover, seeing that
they had already set fire to the town in several places, we were
compelled to seek shelter with our goods and chattels in the
church and fortress, neither of which were as yet touched by the
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the sixteenth, the town itself being then in ashes,
there came a soldier dressed in the Turkish costume, save that he
wore the leather jerkin of a German horseman, into the high
street, and waving a white cloth, he called out in the Hungarian
language, to those of us who were in the fortress, that if we
would ask for grace, both we and ours should be protected, and a
safe conduct (salva quartier) given to us, that should be our
future defence.&nbsp; Thereupon we held honest counsel together,
citizens and neighbours then present, and in the meantime gave
reply, translated also into Hungarian, that if we should agree
thereto, we would set up a white flag upon the tower as a sign of
our submission.&nbsp; Early on the morning of the nineteenth of
July there came a Pasha from the camp at Vienna, at the head of a
great army, and with him the same Turk who had on the previous
day made the proposal to us.&nbsp; And the Pasha sat himself down
upon a red carpet spread on the bare ground, close by the house
of Herr Streninger, till we should agree to his terms.&nbsp; It
was five o&rsquo;clock in the morning before we could make up our
minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when we were all willing to surrender, our
enemies demanded, in the first place, that two of our men should
march out of the fortress as hostages, and that two Turks should
take their places with us; and that a maiden, with loose
streaming hair, and a wreath upon her forehead, should bring
forth the key of the town, seeing that this place had never till
then been taken by an enemy.&nbsp; Further, they demanded six
thousand florins ransom from us, which, however, we abated to
four thousand, handing to them two thousand florins at once, upon
three dishes, with the request that the remainder should be
allowed to stand over till the forthcoming day of John the
Baptist.&nbsp; As soon as this money had been paid over to them,
the Pasha called such of our faithful garrison as were in the
church to come out and arrange themselves in the square, that he
might see how many safe-conducts were required; but, as each
armed man came to the door, his musket was torn out of his hand,
and such as resisted were dragged by the hair of the head into
the square by the Turks, and told that they would need no
weapons, seeing that <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>to those who sought for mercy, the
passes would be sufficient protection.&nbsp; And thus were our
arms carried away from us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the whole garrison, thus utterly
defenceless, were collected in the public square, there sprang
fifty Turks from their horses, and with great rudeness began
searching every one of them for money or other valuables; and the
citizens began already to see that they were betrayed into a
surrender, and some of them tried to make their
escape&mdash;among others, Herr Streninger, the town-justice; but
he was struck down immediately, and he was the first man
murdered.&nbsp; Upon this, the Pasha stood up, and began to call
out with a loud, clear voice to his troops, and as they heard his
words, they fell upon the unarmed men in the market-place, and
hewed them down with their scimitars without pity or
remorse&mdash;sparing none in their eagerness for the butchery,
and which, in spite of their haste, was not ended till between
one and two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; Of all our
citizens, only two escaped the slaughter, and they contrived to
hide themselves in the tower; but those who fled out of the town
were captured by the Tartars, and instantly dispatched.&nbsp;
Then, having committed this cruel barbarism, they seized the
women and children who had been left for safety in the church,
and carried them away into slavery, taking care to burn and
utterly destroy the fortress ere they departed.&nbsp; And when
Vienna was relieved, and the good people there came among the
ruins of Bertholdsdorf, they gathered together the headless and
mangled remains of our murdered citizens to the number of three
thousand five hundred, and buried them all in one
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;eternal remembrance&rdquo; of this catastrophe, the
worthy town-justice, Trinksgeld, in seventeen hundred ordered a
painting to be executed, representing the fearful scene
described.&nbsp; It occupies the whole of one side of the
Town-hall, and in its quaint minuteness of detail, and defiance
of perspective&mdash;depicting, not merely the slaughter of the
betrayed Bertholdsdorfers, but the concealment of the two who
were fortunate enough to escape, and who are helplessly apparent
behind some loose timber&mdash;would be ludicrous, were it not
for the sacred gravity of the subject.</p>
<p>As it is, we quit the romantic little town with a sigh, and
turning our faces towards Vienna, wonder what the young Turks of
eighteen hundred and fifty-four may possibly think of the Old
Turks of one hundred and thirty years ago.</p>

<p>At the &ldquo;Fete de Dieu,&rdquo; in Vienna (the
<i>Frohnleichnamsfest</i>), religious rites are not confined to
the places of worship&mdash;the whole city becomes a
church.&nbsp; Altars rise in every street, and high mass is
performed in the open air, amid clouds of incense and showers of
holy water.&nbsp; The Emperor himself and his family swell the
procession.</p>
<p>I had taken a cheering glass of Kronewetter with the worthy
landlord of my lodgings, and sauntered forth to observe the
day&rsquo;s proceedings.&nbsp; I crossed the Platz of St. Ulrick,
and thence proceeded to the high street of Mariahilf&mdash;an
important suburb of Vienna.&nbsp; I passed two stately altars on
my way, and duly raised my hat, in obedience to the custom of the
country.&nbsp; A little crowd was collected round the parish
church of Mariahilf; and, anticipating that a procession would
pass, I took my stand among the rest of the expectant
populace.&nbsp; A few assistant police, in light blue-grey
uniforms with green facings, kept the road.</p>
<p>A bustle about the church-door, and a band of priests,
attendants, and&mdash;what pleased me most&mdash;a troop of
pretty little girls came, two and two, down the steps, and into
the road.&nbsp; I remember nothing of the procession but those
beautiful and innocent children, adorned with wreaths and ribbons
for the occasion.&nbsp; I was thinking of the rosy faces I had
left at home, when my reflections were interrupted by a
peremptory voice, exclaiming, &ldquo;Take off your
hat!&rdquo;&nbsp; I should have obeyed with alacrity at any other
moment; but there was something in the manner and tone of the
&ldquo;Polizeidiener&rsquo;s&rdquo; address which touched my
pride, and made me obstinate.&nbsp; I drew back a little.&nbsp;
The order was repeated; the crowd murmured.&nbsp; I half turned
to go; but, the next moment, my hat was struck off my head by the
police-assistant.</p>
<p>What followed was mere confusion.&nbsp; I struck the
&ldquo;Polizeidiener;&rdquo; and, in return, received several
blows on the head from behind with <!-- page 100--><a

stick.&nbsp; In less than ten minutes I was lodged in the
police-office of the district; my hat broken and my clothes
bespattered with the blood which had dropped, and was still
dropping, from the wounds in my head.</p>
<p>I had full time to reflect upon the obstinate folly which had
produced this result; nor were my reflections enlivened by the
manners of the police-agents attached to the office.&nbsp; They
threatened me with heavy pains and punishments; and the
Polizeidiener whom I had struck, assured me, while stanching his
still-bleeding nose, that I should have at least &ldquo;three
months for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several hours&rsquo; waiting in the dreary office, I was
abruptly called into the commissioner&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; The
commissioner was seated at a table with writing materials before
him, and commenced immediately, in a sharp offensive tone, a
species of examination.&nbsp; After my name and country had been
demanded, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what religion are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Protestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&nbsp; Leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had made no complaint of my bruises, because I did not think
this the proper place to do so; although the man who dealt them
was present.&nbsp; He had assisted, stick in hand, in taking me
to the police-office.&nbsp; He was in earnest conversation with
the Polizeidiener, but soon left the office.&nbsp; From that
instant I never saw him again; nor, in spite of repeated demands,
could I ever obtain redress for, or even recognition of, the
violence I had suffered.</p>
<p>Another weary hour, and I was consigned to the care of a
police-soldier; who, armed with sabre and stick, conducted me
through the crowded city to prison.&nbsp; It was then two
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>The prison, situated in the Spengler Gasse, is called the
&ldquo;Polizei-Haupt-Direction.&rdquo;&nbsp; We descended a
narrow gut, which had no outlet, except through the prison
gates.&nbsp; They were slowly opened at the summons of my
conductor.&nbsp; I was beckoned into a long gloomy apartment,
lighted from one side only, and having a long counter running
down its centre; chains and handcuffs hung upon the walls.</p>
<p>An official was standing behind the counter.&nbsp; He asked me
abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From England,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;In Great Britain; close to France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questioner behind the counter cast an inquiring look at my
escort:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The subordinate answered him in a pleasant way, that I had
spoken the truth.&nbsp; Happily an Englishman, it seems, is a
rarity within those prison walls.</p>
<p>I was passed into an adjoining room, which reminded me of the
back parlour of a Holywell Street clothes shop, only that it was
rather lighter.&nbsp; Its sides consisted entirely of sets of
great pigeon-holes, each occupied by the habiliments or effects
of some prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any valuables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; My purse, watch, and pin were
rendered up, ticketed, and, deposited in one of the
compartments.&nbsp; I was then beckoned into a long paved passage
or corridor down some twenty stone steps, into the densest
gloom.&nbsp; Presently I discerned before me a massive door
studded with bosses, and crossed with bars and bolts.&nbsp; A
police-soldier, armed with a drawn sabre, guarded the entrance to
Punishment Room No. 1.&nbsp; The bolts gave way; and, in a few
moments, I was a prisoner within.</p>
<p>Punishment Room No. 1, is a chamber some fifteen paces long by
six broad, with a tolerably high ceiling and whitened
walls.&nbsp; It has but two windows, and they are placed at each
end of one side of the chamber.&nbsp; They are of good height,
and look out upon an inclosed gravelled space, variegated with a
few patches of verdure.&nbsp; The room is tolerably light.&nbsp;
On each side are shelves, as in barracks, for sleeping.&nbsp; In
one corner, by the window, is a stone sink; in another, a good
supply of water.</p>
<p>Such is the prison; but the prisoners!&nbsp; There were
forty-eight&mdash;grey-haired men and puny boys&mdash;all ragged,
and stalking with slippered feet from end to end with listless
eyes.&nbsp; Some, all eagerness; some, crushed and motionless;
some, scared and stupid; now singing, now swearing, now rushing
about playing at some mad game; now hushed or whispering, as the
loud voice of the Vater (or father of the ward) is heard above
the uproar, calling out &ldquo;Ruhe!&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Order!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>On my entrance I was instantly surrounded by a dozen of the
younger jail-birds, amid a shout of &ldquo;Ein Zuwachs!&nbsp; Ein
Zuwachs!&rdquo; which I was not long in understanding to be the
name given to the last comer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was haben sie?&rdquo;
(What have you done?) was the next <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>eager
cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Struck a Polizeidiener!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ei!
das ist gut!&rdquo; was the hearty exclamation; and I was a
favourite immediately.&nbsp; One dirty villanous-looking fellow,
with but one eye, and very little light in that, took to handling
my clothes; then inquired if I had any money &ldquo;up
above?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon my answering in the affirmative my
popularity immediately increased.&nbsp; They soon made me
understand that I could &ldquo;draw&rdquo; upon the pigeon-hole
bank to indulge in any such luxuries as beer or tobacco.</p>
<p>People breakfast early in Vienna; and, as I had tasted nothing
since that meal, I was very hungry; but I was not to starve; for
soon we heard the groaning of bolts and locks, and the
police-soldier who guarded the door appeared, bearing in his hand
a red earthen pot, surmounted by a round flat loaf of bread
&ldquo;for the Englishman.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took my portion with
thanks, and found that the pipkin contained a thick porridge made
of lentils, prepared with meal and fat; in the midst of which was
a piece of fresh boiled beef.&nbsp; The cake was of a darkish
colour; but good wholesome bread.&nbsp; Altogether, the meal was
not unsavoury.&nbsp; Many a greedy eye watched me as I sat on the
end of the hard couch, eating my dinner.&nbsp; One wretched man
seeing that I did not eat all, whispered a proposal to barter his
dirty neckerchief&mdash;which he took off in my
presence&mdash;for half of my loaf.&nbsp; I satisfied his
desires, but declined the recompense.&nbsp; My half-emptied
pipkin was thankfully taken by another man, under the pretence of
&ldquo;cleaning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of my fellow-prisoners approached me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;do you know
what you have got to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the Zuwachs (latest accession), and it is your
business to empty and clean out the &lsquo;Kiefel&rsquo;&rdquo;
(the sink, etc.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I dare say,&rdquo; he added, carelessly, &ldquo;if
you pay the Vater a &lsquo;mass-bier,&rsquo;&rdquo; (something
less than a quart of beer), &ldquo;he will make some of the boys
do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a rug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must ask the Corporal, at seven o&rsquo;clock; but
I dare say the Vater will find you one&mdash;for a
&lsquo;mass-bier&rsquo;&mdash;if you ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>I saw that a mass-bier would do a great deal in an
Austrian prison.</p>
<p>The Vater, who was a prisoner like the rest, was appealed
to.&nbsp; He was a tall, burly-looking young man, with a frank
countenance.&nbsp; He had quitted his honest calling of butcher,
and had taken to smuggling tobacco into the city.&nbsp; This is a
heavy crime; for the growth, manufacture, and sale of tobacco is
a strict Imperial monopoly.&nbsp; Accordingly, his punishment had
been proportionately severe&mdash;two years&rsquo;
imprisonment.&nbsp; The sentence was now approaching completion;
and, on account of good conduct, he had received the appointment
of Vater to Punishment Room No. 1.&nbsp; The benefits were
enumerated to me with open eyes by one of the
prisoners&mdash;&ldquo;Double rations, two rugs, and a mass-bier
a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of my application to the Vater was the instant
calling out of several young lads, who crouched all day in the
darkest end of the room&mdash;a condemned corner, abounding in
vermin; and I heard no more of the sink and so forth.&nbsp; The
next day a newcomer occupied my position.</p>
<p>At about seven o&rsquo;clock the bolts were again withdrawn,
the ponderous door opened, and the Corporal&mdash;who seemed to
fill the office of ward-inspector&mdash;marched into the
chamber.&nbsp; He was provided with a small note-book and a
pencil, and made a general inquiry into the wants and complaints
of the prisoners.&nbsp; Several of them asked for little
indulgences.&nbsp; All these were duly noted down to be complied
with the next day&mdash;always supposing that the prisoner
possessed a small capital &ldquo;up above.&rdquo;&nbsp; I stepped
forward, and humbly made my request for a rug.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed the Corporal, eyeing me
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! you are the
Englishman?&mdash;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard some one near me mutter: &ldquo;So; struck a
policeman!&nbsp; No mercy for him from the other
policemen&mdash;any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vater dared not help me; but two of his most intimate
friends made me lie down between them; and, swaddled in their
rugs, I passed the night miserably.&nbsp; The hard boards, and
the vermin, effectually broke my slumbers.</p>
<p>The morning came.&nbsp; The rules of the prison required that
we should all rise at six, roll up the rugs, lay them at the
heads of our beds, and sweep out the room.&nbsp; Weary and sore,
I paced the prison while these things were done.&nbsp; Even the
morning ablution was comfortless and distressing; a
pocket-handkerchief serving but indifferently for a towel.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Restless activity now took full possession of the
prisoners.&nbsp; There was not the combined shouting or singing
of the previous day; but there was independent action, which
broke out in various ways.&nbsp; Hunger had roused them; the
prison allowance is one meal a day: and although, by husbanding
the supply, some few might eke it out into several repasts, the
majority had no such control over their appetite.&nbsp; Tall,
gaunt lads, just starting into men, went roaming about with wild
eyes, purposeless, pipkin in hand, although hours must elapse
before the meal would come.&nbsp; Caged beasts pace their narrow
prisons with the same uniform and unvarying motion.</p>
<p>At last eleven o&rsquo;clock came.&nbsp; The barred door
opened, and swiftly, yet with a terrible restraint&mdash;knowing
that the least disorder would cost them a day&rsquo;s
dinner&mdash;the prisoners mounted the stone steps, and passed
slowly, in single file, before two enormous caldrons.&nbsp; A
cook, provided with a long ladle, stood by the side of each; and,
with a dexterous plunge and a twist, a portion of porridge and a
small block of beef were fished up and dashed into the pipkin
extended by each prisoner.&nbsp; Another official stood ready
with the flat loaves.&nbsp; In a very short time, the whole of
the prisoners were served.</p>
<p>Hunger seasoned the mess; and I was sitting on the
bedstead-end enjoying it, when the police-soldier appeared on the
threshold, calling me by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must leave&mdash;instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; I said, starting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a rug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hurried out into the dark passage.&nbsp; I was conducted to
the left; another heavy door was loosened, and I was thrust into
a gloomy cell, bewildered, and almost speechless with
alarm.&nbsp; I was not alone.&nbsp; Some half-dozen melancholy
wretches, crouching in one corner, were disturbed by my entrance;
but half-an-hour had scarcely elapsed, when the police-soldier
again appeared, and I was hurried out.&nbsp; We proceeded through
the passage by which I had first entered.&nbsp; In my way past
the nest of pigeon-holes &ldquo;up above,&rdquo; my valuables
were restored to me.&nbsp; Presently a single police-soldier led
me into the open street.</p>
<p>The beautiful air and sunshine! how I enjoyed them as we
passed through the heart of the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bei&rsquo;m
Magistrat,&rdquo; at the corner of the Kohlmarkt was our
destination.&nbsp; We entered its porticoed door, ascended the
stone stairs, and went into a small office, where <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>the most repulsive-looking official I have anywhere
seen, noted my arrival in a book.&nbsp; Thence we passed into
another pigeon-holed chamber, where I delivered up my little
property, as before, &ldquo;for its security.&rdquo;&nbsp; A few
minutes more, and I was safely locked in a small chamber, having
one window darkened by a wooden blind.&nbsp; My companions were a
few boys, a courier&mdash;who, to my surprise, addressed me in
English&mdash;and a man with blazing red hair.</p>
<p>In this place I passed four days, occupied by what I suppose I
may designate &ldquo;my trial.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first day was
enlivened by a violent attack which the jailer made upon the
red-haired man for looking out of window.&nbsp; He seized the
fiery locks, and beat their owner&rsquo;s head against the
wall.&nbsp; I had to submit that day to a degrading medical
examination.</p>
<p>On the second day I was called to appear before the
&ldquo;<i>Rath</i>,&rdquo; or counsel.&nbsp; The process of
examination is curious.&nbsp; It is considered necessary to the
complete elucidation of a case, that the whole life and parentage
of the accused should be made known; and I was thus exposed to a
series of questions which I had never anticipated:&mdash;The
names and countries of both of my parents; their station; the
ages, names, and birthplaces of my brothers and sisters; my own
babyhood, education, subsequent behaviour, and adventures; my own
account, with the minutest details of the offence I had
committed.&nbsp; It was more like a private conference than an
examination.&nbsp; The Rath was alone&mdash;with the exception of
his secretary, who diligently recorded my answers.&nbsp; While
being thus perseveringly catechised, the Rath sauntered up and
down; putting his interminable questions in a friendly chatty
way, as though he were taking a kindly interest in my history,
rather than pursuing a judicial investigation.&nbsp; When the
examination was concluded, the secretary read over every word to
me, and I confirmed the report with my signature.</p>
<p>The Rath promised to do what he could for me; and I was then
surprised and pleased by the entrance of my employer.&nbsp; The
Rath recommended him to write to the English Embassy in my
behalf, and allowed him to send me outer clothing better suited
to the interior of a prison than the best clothes I had donned to
spend the holiday in.</p>
<p>I went back to my cell with a lightened heart.&nbsp; I was,
however, a little disconcerted on my return by the courier, who
related an anecdote of a groom, of his acquaintance, who had
persisted in <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>smoking a cigar while passing a
sentinel; and who, in punishment therefor, had been beaten by a
number of soldiers, with willow rods; and whose yells of pain had
been heard far beyond the prison walls.&nbsp; What an
anticipation!&nbsp; Was I to be similarly served?&nbsp; I thought
it rather a suspicious circumstance that my new friend appeared
to be thoroughly conversant with all the details (I suspect from
personal experience) of the police and prison system of
Vienna.&nbsp; He told me (but I had no means of testing the
correctness of his information) that there were twenty
Rathsherrn, or Counsellors; that each had his private chamber,
and was assisted by a confidential secretary; that every offender
underwent a private examination by the Rath appointed to
investigate his case&mdash;the Rath having the power to call all
witnesses, and to examine them, singly, or otherwise, as he
thought proper; that on every Thursday the
&ldquo;Rathsherrn&rdquo; met in conclave; that each Rath brought
forward the particular cases which he had investigated, explained
all their bearings, attested his report by documentary evidence
prepared by his secretary, and pronounced his opinion as to the
amount of punishment to be inflicted.&nbsp; The question was then
decided by a majority.</p>
<p>On the third day, I was suddenly summoned before the Rath, and
found myself side by side with my accuser.&nbsp; He was in
private clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Tuci,&rdquo; exclaimed the Rath, trying to
pronounce my name, but utterly disguising it, &ldquo;you have
misinformed me.&nbsp; The constable says he did not <i>knock</i>
your hat off&mdash;he only <i>pulled</i> it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I adhered to my statement.&nbsp; The Polizeidiener nudged my
elbow, and whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed&mdash;it will
not go hard with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, constable,&rdquo; said the Rath; &ldquo;what harm
have you suffered in this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uniform is stained with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From <i>my</i> head!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From <i>my</i> nose,&rdquo; interposed the
Polizeidiener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case it will wash out,&rdquo; said the Rath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; he added, turning to
me,&mdash;&ldquo;are you willing to indemnify this man for damage
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assented; and was then removed.</p>
<p>On the following morning I was again summoned to the
Rath&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp; His secretary, who was alone, met me
with smiles and congratulations: he announced to me the
sentence&mdash;four days&rsquo; <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>imprisonment.&nbsp; I am afraid I did not evince that
degree of pleasure which was expected from me; but I thanked him,
was removed, and, in another hour, was reconducted to Punishment
Room No. 1.</p>
<p>The four days of sentence formed the lightest part of the
adventure.&nbsp; My mind was at ease: I knew the worst.&nbsp;
Additions to my old companions had arrived in the interval.&nbsp;
We had an artist among us, who was allowed, in consideration of
his talents, to retain a sharp cutting implement fashioned by
himself from a flat piece of steel&mdash;knives and books being,
as the most dangerous objects in prison, rigidly abstracted from
us.&nbsp; He manufactured landscapes in straw, gummed upon pieces
of blackened wood.&nbsp; Straw was obtained, in a natural state,
of green, yellow, and brown; and these, when required, were
converted into differently-tinted reds, by a few hours&rsquo;
immersion in the Kiefel.&nbsp; He also kneaded bread in the hand,
until it became as plastic as clay.&nbsp; This he modelled into
snuffboxes (with strips of rag for hinges, and a piece of
whalebone for a spring), draughts, chess-men, pipe-bowls, and
other articles.&nbsp; When dry, they became hard and serviceable;
and he sold them among the prisoners and the prison
officials.&nbsp; He obtained thus a number of comforts not
afforded by the prison regulations.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I attended the Catholic chapel attached to the
prison&mdash;a damp unwholesome cell.&nbsp; I stood among a knot
of prisoners, enveloped in a nauseous vapour; for there arose
musty, mouldy, effluvia which gradually overpowered my
senses.&nbsp; I felt them leaving me, and tottered towards the
door.&nbsp; I was promptly met by a man who seemed provided for
emergencies of the kind; for he held a vessel of cold water,
poured some of it into my hands, and directed me to bathe my
temples.&nbsp; I partly recovered; and, faint and dispirited,
staggered back to the prison.&nbsp; I had not, however, lain long
upon my bed (polished and slippery from constant use), when the
prison guard came to my side, holding in his hand a smoking basin
of egg soup &ldquo;for the Englishman.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was sent
by the mistress of the kitchen.&nbsp; I received the offering of
a kind heart to a foreigner in trouble, with a blessing on the
donor.</p>
<p>On the following Tuesday, after an imprisonment of, in all,
nine days, during which I had never slept without my clothes, I
was discharged from the prison.&nbsp; In remembrance of the
place, I brought <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>away with me a straw landscape and a
bread snuff-box, the works of the prison artist.</p>
<p>On reaching my lodging I looked into my box.&nbsp; It was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are my books and papers?&rdquo; I asked my
landlord.</p>
<p>The police had taken them on the day after my arrest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my bank-notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; exclaimed my landlord,
triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expected the police; I knew you had
money somewhere, so I took the liberty of searching until I found
it.&nbsp; The police made particular inquiries about your cash,
and went away disappointed, taking the other things with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would they have appropriated it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&nbsp; Very likely&mdash;under pretence of paying
your expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On application to the police of the district, I received the
whole of my effects back.&nbsp; One of my books was detained for
about a week; a member of the police having taken it home to
read, and being, as I apprehend, a slow reader.</p>
<p>It was matter of great astonishment, both to my friends and to
the police, that I escaped with so slight a punishment.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">what my landlord
believed</span>.</p>
<p>My Bohemian landlord in Vienna told me a story of an English
nobleman.&nbsp; It may be worth relating, as showing what my
landlord, quite in good faith and earnest, believed.</p>
<p>You know, Lieber Herr, said Vater B&ouml;hm, there is nothing
in the whole Kaiserstadt so astonishing to strangers as our
signboards.&nbsp; Those beautiful paintings that you see&mdash;Am
Graben and Hohe Markt,&mdash;real works of art, with which the
sign-boards of other countries are no more to be compared, than
your hum-drum English music is to the delicious waltzes of
Lanner, or the magic polkas of Strauss.&nbsp; Imagine an
Englishman, who knows nothing of painting, finding himself all at
once in front of one of those charming
compositions&mdash;pictures that they would make a gallery of in
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>London, but which we can afford to put out of doors; he
is fixed, he is dumb with astonishment and delight&mdash;he goes
mad.&nbsp; Well, Lieber Herr, this is exactly what happened to
one of your English nobility.&nbsp; Milor arrived in Vienna; and
as he had made a wager that he would see every notability in the
city and its environs in the course of three days, which was all
the time he could spare, he hired a fiaker at the Tabor-Linie,
and drove as fast as the police would let him from church to
theatre; from museum to wine-cellar; till chance and the fiaker
brought him into the Graben.&nbsp; Milor got out to stretch
himself, and to see the wonderful shops, and after a few turns
came suddenly upon the house at the sign of the Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goddam!&rdquo; exclaimed Milor, as his eye met the
sign-board.</p>
<p>There he stood, this English nobleman, in his drab coat with
pearl buttons, his red neckcloth, blue pantaloons and white hat,
transfixed for at least five minutes.&nbsp; Then, swearing some
hard oaths&mdash;a thing the English always do when they are
particularly pleased&mdash;Milor exclaimed, &ldquo;It is
exquisite!&nbsp; Holy Lord Mayor, it is unbelievable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mein Lieber, you have seen that painting of course, I mean
Joan of Arc, life-size, clad in steel, sword in hand, and with a
wonderful serenity expressed in her countenance, as she leads her
flagging troops once more to the attack upon the walls.&nbsp; It
has all the softness of a Coreggio, and the vigour of a
Rubens.&nbsp; Milor gave three bounds, and was in the middle of
the shop in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That picture!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What picture&mdash;Eurer Gnaden?&rdquo; inquired the
shopkeeper, bowing in the most elegant manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hangs at your door&mdash;Joan of Arc, I wish to buy
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for sale, Eurer Gnaden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; ejaculated Milor, &ldquo;I must have
it.&nbsp; I will cover it with guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How impossible?&rdquo; cried Milor, diving into the
capacious pocket of the drab coat with the pearl buttons, and
drawing forth a heavy roll of English bank-notes,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you anything you like that it is
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know, mein Lieber, that the English settle everything by a
wager; indeed, betting and swearing is about all their language
is fit for.&nbsp; For a fact, there were once two English
noblemen, from Manchester or some such ancient place, who
journeyed down the <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Rhine on the steam-boat.&nbsp; They
looked neither to the right nor to the left; neither at the
vine-fields nor the old castles; but sat at a table, silent and
occupied with nothing before them but two lumps of sugar, and two
heaps of guineas.&nbsp; A little crowd gathered round them
wondering what it might mean.&nbsp; Suddenly one of them cried
out, &ldquo;Goddam, it&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
yours?&rdquo; inquired one who stood by, gaping with
curiosity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; replied the
other, &ldquo;I bet twenty guineas level, that the first fly
would alight upon my lump of sugar, and by God, I&rsquo;ve won
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To return to Milor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you anything
you like that it is possible,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your grace,&rdquo; replied the shopkeeper, &ldquo;my
Joan of Arc is beyond price to me.&nbsp; It draws all the town to
my shop; not forgetting the foreigners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will buy your shop,&rdquo; said the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milor!&nbsp; Graf Schweinekopf von Pimplestein called
only yesterday to see it, and Le Comte de Barbebiche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Frenchman!&rdquo; shouted Milor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Paris, your grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sell me your Joan of Arc?&rdquo; was the
furious demand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will cover it with pounds sterling
twice over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le Comte de Barbebiche&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have promised it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; gasped Herr Wechsel, catching at the
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; cried the English nobleman; and he
strode into the street.&nbsp; With one impassioned glance at the
figure of La Pucelle, he threw himself into his fiaker, and drove
rapidly out of sight.</p>
<p>On reaching his hotel, he chose two pairs of boxing gloves, a
set of rapiers, and a case of duelling pistols; and, thus loaded,
descended to his fiaker, tossed them in, and started off in the
direction of the nearest hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Le Comte de
Barbebiche&rdquo;&mdash;that was the pass-word; but everywhere it
failed to elicit the desired reply.&nbsp; He passed from street
to street&mdash;from gasthaus to gasthaus&mdash;everywhere the
same dreary negative; and the day waned, and his search was still
unsuccessful.&nbsp; But he never relaxed; the morning found him
still pursuing his inquiries; and midday saw him at the porte
coch&eacute;re of the Hotel of the Holy Ghost, in the Rothenthurm
Strasse, with his case of duelling pistols in his hand, his set
of rapiers under his arm, and his two pairs of boxing-gloves
slung round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deliver my card immediately to the Comte,&rdquo; said
he to the <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>attendant; &ldquo;and tell him I am
waiting.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had found him out.&nbsp; Luckily, the
Comte de Barbebiche happened to be in the best possible humour
when this message was conveyed to him, having just succeeded in
dyeing his moustache to his entire satisfaction.&nbsp; He glanced
at the card&mdash;smiled at himself complacently in the mirror
before him, and answered in a gracious voice, &ldquo;Let Milor
Mountpleasant come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milor was soon heard upon the stairs; and, as he strode into
the room, he flung his set of rapiers with a clatter on the
floor, dashed his case of duelling pistols on the table, and with
a dexterous twist sent one pair of boxing-gloves rolling at the
feet of the Comte, while, pulling on the other, he stood in an
attitude of defence before the astonished Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; inquired the Comte de
Barbebiche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the alternative,&rdquo; cried the
Englishman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are weapons; take your
choice&mdash;pistols, rapiers, or the gloves.&nbsp; Fight with
one of them you must and shall, or abandon your claim to Joan of
Arc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu!&nbsp; What Joan of Arc?&nbsp; I do not have
the felicity of knowing the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may see her, Am Graben,&rdquo; gravely replied
Milor, &ldquo;outside a shop door, done in oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Comte, &ldquo;in
oil&mdash;an Esquimaux, or a Tartar, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Comte, I want no trifling.&nbsp; Do you
persist in the purchase of this picture?&nbsp; I have set my
heart upon it; I love it; I have sworn to possess it.&nbsp; Make
it a matter of money, and I will give you a thousand pounds for
your bargain; make it a matter of dispute, and I will fight you
for it to the death; make it a matter of friendship, and yield up
your right, and I will embrace you as a brother, and be your
debtor for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Comte de Barbebiche&mdash;seeing that he had to do with an
Englishman a degree, at least, more crazed than the rest of his
countrymen&mdash;entered into the spirit of the matter at once,
and chose the easiest means of extricating himself from a
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milor,&rdquo; he exclaimed, advancing towards him,
&ldquo;I am charmed with your sentiments, your courage, and your
integrity.&nbsp; Take her, Milor&mdash;take your Joan of Arc; I
would not attempt to deprive you of her if she were a real flesh
and blood Pucelle, and my own sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>The Englishman, with a grand oath, seized the
Comte&rsquo;s hand in both his own, and shook it heartily; then
scrambling up his paraphernalia of war, spoke a hurried farewell,
and disappeared down the stairs.</p>
<p>The grey of the morning saw Milor in full evening costume,
pacing the Graben with hurried steps, watching with anxious eyes
the shop front where his beloved was wont to hang.&nbsp; He saw
her carried out like a shutter from the house, and duly suspended
on the appointed hook.&nbsp; She had lost none of her charms, and
he stood with arms folded upon his breast, entranced for awhile
before the figure of the valiant maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Wechsel,&rdquo; said he abruptly, as he entered
the shop; &ldquo;Le Comte de Barbebiche has ceded his claim to
me.&nbsp; I repeat my offer for your Joan of Arc&mdash;decide at
once, for I am in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly does appear surprising that Herr Wechsel did not
close in with the offer at once; perhaps he really had an
affection for his picture; perhaps he thought to improve the
bargain; or, more probably, looking upon his strange customer as
so undoubtedly mad, as to entertain serious fears as to his ever
receiving the money.&nbsp; Certain it is, that he respectfully
declined to sell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse!&rdquo; shouted Milor, striking his clenched
fist upon the counter; &ldquo;then, by Jove! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;but
never mind!&rdquo; and he strode into the street.</p>
<p>The dusk of the evening saw Milor in the dress of a porter,
pacing the Graben with a steady step.&nbsp; He halted in front of
his cherished Joan; with the utmost coolness and deliberation
unhooked the painting from its nail, and placing it carefully,
and with the air of a workman, upon his shoulder, stalked away
with his precious burden.</p>
<p>Imagine the consternation of Herr Wechsel upon the discovery
of his loss.&nbsp; His pride, his delight, the chief ornament of
his shop was gone; and, moreover, he had lost his money.&nbsp;
But his sorrow was changed into surprise, and his half-tearful
eyes twinkled with satisfaction as he read the following epistle,
delivered into his hands within an hour after the
occurrence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;You will find placed to your
credit in the Imperial Bank of Vienna the sum of five thousand
pounds, the amount proffered for your Joan of Arc.&nbsp; Your
obstinacy has driven me into the commission of a
misdemeanour.&nbsp; God forgive you.&nbsp; But I have kept my
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am already beyond your reach, and you will search in
vain for my trace.&nbsp; <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>In
consideration for your feelings, and to cause you as little
annoyance as possible, I have placed <i>my</i> Joan of Arc into
the hands of a skilful artist; and I trust to forward you as
accurate a copy as can be made.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours, <span
class="smcap">Mountpleasant</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Milor kept his word, mein Lieber, and the copy hangs Am
Graben to this day in the place of the original.&nbsp; The
original shines among the paintings in the splendid collection of
Milor at Mountpleasant Castle.</p>
<p>I will not pretend to say, concluded Vater B&ouml;hm,
reloading his pipe, that the English have any taste, but they
certainly have a strange passion for pictures; and, let them once
get an idea into their heads, they are the most obstinate people
in the world in the pursuit of it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">an execution at
vienna</span>.</p>
<p>Carl Fickte, a native of Vienna, stood condemned for
execution.&nbsp; His crime was murder.&nbsp; He was convicted of
having enveigled his nephew, of eight years old, to the
M&ouml;lker bastion of the city fortification, and of having
thrown him over the parapet into the dry ditch below.&nbsp; The
depth of the fall was between thirty and forty feet, and the
shattered body of the boy explained his miserable death.&nbsp;
His nephew&rsquo;s cloak became loosened in the struggle, and
remained in the hands of Fickte, who sold it, and spent the
produce in a night&rsquo;s debauch.&nbsp; This cloak led to the
discovery of the murderer, and after a lapse of eight months to
his conviction and execution.</p>
<p>I had resolved to witness the last act of the law, and started
from home at six o&rsquo;clock on the appointed morning.&nbsp; A
white mist filled the air, and gradually thickened into rain; and
by the time I had reached the spot&mdash;a distance of about two
miles&mdash;a smart shower was falling.&nbsp; The place of
execution is a field in the outskirts of the city, bounded on one
side by the main road, and close to the &ldquo;Spinnerinn am
Kreuz,&rdquo; an ancient stone cross, standing on <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>the edge of the highway.&nbsp; From this spot a
beautiful view of the city is obtained.</p>
<p>The crowd was already gathering, and carts, benches, and
platforms were in course of arrangement by enterprising
speculators, for the accommodation of the people.&nbsp; A low
bank which skirted the field was soon occupied, and every swell
of the ground was taken advantage of.&nbsp; Soon the rain fell in
torrents, and the earth became sodden and yielding; but no
pelting shower, no sinking clay, could drive the anxious crowd
from the attractive spectacle.&nbsp; Still on they came, men and
women together; laughing and joking; their clothes tucked about
them, and umbrella-laden.&nbsp; Over the field; on to the
slippery bank, whence, every now and again, arose a burst of
uproar and laughter, as some part of the mound gave way, and
precipitated a snugly-packed crowd into the swamp below.</p>
<p>Venders of fruit, sausages, bread, and spirits, occupied every
eligible situation, and from the early hour, and the unprepared
state of the spectators, found abundant patronage.</p>
<p>A clatter was heard from the city side, and a body of mounted
police galloped along the high road, halted at the gallows, and
formed themselves into a hollow square around it.&nbsp; The
gibbet was unlike our own, it had no platform, and no steps; but
was a simple frame formed by two strong upright, and one
horizontal beam.&nbsp; There was a little entanglement of pulleys
and ropes, which I learned to understand at a later hour.</p>
<p>Still the rain came pouring down, in one uninterrupted flood,
that nothing but the excitement of a public execution could
withstand.&nbsp; And still the people clustered together in a
dense crowd, under the open air and pelting rain, shifting and
reeling, splashing and staggering, till the field became trodden
into a heavy, clinging paste of a full foot deep.&nbsp; But no
one left the spot; they had come for the sight, and see it they
would.&nbsp; Over the whole field and bank, and rising ground, a
perfect sea of umbrellas waved and swayed with the crowd, as they
vainly sought a firmer resting place among the clogging
clay.&nbsp; An hour went by, but there was no change, except a
continued accession to the crowd.&nbsp; It was wonderful how
patiently they stood under the watery hurricane; helplessly
embedded in a slimy swamp; feverish and anxious; with no thought
but the looming gallows, towards which all eyes were turned, and
the miserable culprit, whose sudden end they were awaiting to
see.</p>
<p>Fagged, at length, and soaked with rain, I left the slough,
and <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>gaining the highroad, pressed
towards the city to meet the cavalcade.&nbsp; A rushing of
people, and a confused cry, told me of its approach.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, there! in that open cart,
surrounded by mounted police, and pressed on all sides by a
hurrying crowd.&nbsp; On either side of him sit the prison
officials; while in front, an energetic priest, with all the
vehemence and gesticulation of the wildest religious fervour, is
evidently urging him to repentance.</p>
<p>It is the law of Austria, that no criminal, however distinctly
his crime may have been proved by circumstantial evidence, can
suffer death, till he has himself confirmed the evidence by
confession.&nbsp; But any artifice can be lawfully employed to
entrap him into an acknowledgment of his guilt; therefore,
although the sentence of the law may often be deferred, it is
rare indeed that its completion is averted.&nbsp; Fickte had of
course confessed.&nbsp; A flush was on his face; but there was no
life or intellectual spirit there.</p>
<p>Another battle with the crowd, and I stood in the rear of the
gibbet.&nbsp; After a weary interval, the
scharfrichter&mdash;executioner&mdash;mounted, by means of a
ladder, to the cross beam of the gallows.&nbsp; By the action of
a wheel the culprit slowly rose into the air, but still
unhurt.&nbsp; Three broad leathern straps confined his arms; and
perfectly motionless, held in a perpendicular position by cordage
fixed to the ground, and to the beam above, he awaited his
death.&nbsp; No cap covered his face.&nbsp; A looped cord passing
through another pulley, was placed under his chin, the cord
running along the cross-beam, and the end fixed to a wheel at the
side of the gibbet.</p>
<p>The culprit kissed the crucifix; a single turn of the wheel; a
hoarse cry of &ldquo;Down with the umbrellas!&rdquo; and his life
had passed away; though no cry, no struggle, announced its
departure.&nbsp; The scharfrichter laid his hand upon the heart
of the criminal, then, assured of his death, descended.&nbsp; And
still, amid the incessant rain, with eager eyes bent upon the
dead, the crowd waited, gloating on the sight.&nbsp; According to
the sentence of the law, the corpse, with nothing to hide its
discoloured and distorted features, remained hanging till the
setting of the sun.</p>
<p>Ashamed, wearied, and horrified, I hurried home; only halting
on my way to purchase the &ldquo;Todesurtheil,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Death-sentence,&rdquo; which was being cried about the
streets.&nbsp; This is an official document, and indeed the only
one with which the people of Vienna are gratified on such a
subject.&nbsp; Trials are not public, nor can <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>they be
reported; and although the whole of the details invariably ooze
out through the police, no authentic account appears before the
public till the sentence is carried out.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Todesurtheil&rdquo; appears, like our &ldquo;Last
Dying Speech,&rdquo; at the time of the execution, but contains
no verses; being a simple, and very brief narrative of the life
and crime of the condemned.&nbsp; He is designated by his
initials only, out of delicacy to his relatives, although his
real name is, somehow or other, already well known.</p>
<p>Six months later there occurred another execution, but I had
no curiosity to witness it.&nbsp; The condemned was a soldier,
who, in a fit of jealousy, had fired upon his mistress; but
killed a bystander instead.&nbsp; There was no mystery about the
affair, and he was condemned to death.</p>
<p>On the day previous to his execution, he was allowed to
receive the visits of his friends and the public.&nbsp; Only a
single person was admitted at a time.&nbsp; He awaited his
visitor (in this instance, an acquaintance of my own), with
calmness and resolution; advanced with outstretched hand to meet
him; greeting him with a hearty salutation.&nbsp; The visitor,
totally unprepared for this, trembled with a cold shudder, as he
received the pressure of the murderer&rsquo;s hand; murmured a
blessing; dropped a few coin into the box for the especial
benefit of his soul, and hurriedly withdrew.</p>
<p>On the following morning the condemned quitted his prison for
the gibbet.&nbsp; But the soldier, unlike the civilian&mdash;the
soldier who has forfeited his right to a military
execution&mdash;must walk to his death.&nbsp; The civilian rides
in the felon&rsquo;s cart; the soldier, in undress, must pace the
weary way on foot.&nbsp; Imagine a death-condemned criminal
walking from the Old Bailey to Copenhagen Fields to the gallows,
and you have a parallel case.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">a jail episode</span>.</p>
<p>While in the full enjoyment of that luxury, &ldquo;A Taste of
Austrian Jails,&rdquo; already related in these pages, I met with
a man whose whole life would seem to signify perversion; a
&ldquo;dirty, villanous-looking fellow, with but one eye, and
very little light in that.&rdquo;&nbsp; A first glance at this
fellow would call up the reflection, &ldquo;Here is the result of
bad <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>education, and bad example, induced
perhaps by natural misfortunes, but the inevitable growth of
filth and wretchedness in a large city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With thin, straggling wisps of hair thrown, as it were, on his
head, a dull glimmer only in his one eye, and his whole features
of a crafty, selfish character&mdash;such he was; clad in a long,
threadbare, snuff-coloured great-coat, reaching almost to his
heels, and which served to hide the trowsers, the frayed ends of
which explained their condition; on his bare feet he wore a pair
of trodden-down slippers, with upper leathers gaping in front
with open mouths; a despicable rascal to look at, and yet this
was a brother of one of the magistrates of Vienna.</p>
<p>It was soon evident to me that this individual was held in
great respect by the rest of the prisoners; such an influence has
education,&mdash;for he was an educated man,&mdash;even in such a
place as a common jail.</p>
<p>I was soon informed of the peculiar talent which gave him a
prominent position.&nbsp; He was an inexhaustible teller of
stories; and, added my informant, &ldquo;he can drink as much
beer as any three men in Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was saying a great deal.</p>
<p>On the second night of my incarceration in Punishment Room No.
1, I had an opportunity of judging of his powers; for, on our
retiring to our boards and rugs, which, according to prison
regulations, we were bound to do at the ringing of the eight
o&rsquo;clock bell, I heard his peculiar voice announce from the
other side of the room, where he lay, propped up against the wall
by the especial indulgence of his comrades, that he was about to
tell a story.&nbsp; I could not sleep, but lay upon the hard
planks listening, as he recounted with a wonderful power of
language, and no mean amount of elocutionary dignity, some
principal incidents in the life of Napoleon.&nbsp; His companions
lay entranced; they did not sleep, for I could hear their
whispers, and, now and then, their uneasy shiftings on the
relentless wood.&nbsp; And so he went on, and I fell off to sleep
before he had come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>This was repeated each night of my confinement, for which he
received his due payment in beer from his fellow prisoners.</p>
<p>He professed to have a great affection for me; would take my
arm, and walk with me up and down the ward, telling me of his
acquirements, little scraps of his history, and invariably making
a request for a little beer.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>On one occasion it was suggested by the
&ldquo;Vater&rdquo; that he should tell us his own story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My story!&rdquo; chuckled the unashamed rascal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, all Vienna knows my story.&nbsp; I am the brother of
Rathherr Lech, of the Imperial-royal-city-police-bureau of
Vienna.&nbsp; My brother is a great man; I am a vagabond.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> deserves it, and <i>I</i> deserve it; but he is my
brother for all that, and I put him in mind of it now and
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother, by his zeal and talent, has acquired great
learning, and raised himself to a position of honour and
independence.&nbsp; And why have I not done the same?&nbsp;
Because I am lazy, have got weak eyes, and am fond of beer.&nbsp;
I do not care for your wine; good Liesinger beer is the drink for
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother wished me to attain a lofty position in the
world.&nbsp; I am the younger.&nbsp; He paid teachers to instruct
me, and I learned a great deal; but it was dry work, and I sought
change, after days of study, in beer-cellars, among a few choice
boosers.&nbsp; And my eyes were weak, and close study made them
worse; and many a day I stole from my lessons on the plea of
failing sight.&nbsp; My brother, who is a good fellow, only that
he does not sufficiently consider my weakness, employed
physicians and oculists out of number; and among them I lost the
sight of one eye.&nbsp; It was of no use; I did not like the
labour of learning, and I made my weak eyes an excuse for doing
less than I could have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I gave it up altogether, and my brother got me
into the &lsquo;Institute for the Blind.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>That</i>
would not do for me at all; I was not blind enough for
<i>that</i>.&nbsp; So, one day, when the door was open, and the
weather fine, I strolled home again to my brother.&nbsp; This
vexed him greatly; but he got over it, and then he placed me in
the &lsquo;Imperial Bounty.&rsquo;&nbsp; A stylish place, I can
tell you, where few but nobles were allowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could I, a lusty young fellow, be happy among
that moping, musty, crampt-up lot of old respectables?&nbsp; Not
I! so, as I could not easily get out in the day-time, I ran away
one night, and went back to my old quarters.&nbsp; At first my
brother would not see me; but that passed over, for he could not
let me starve.&nbsp; He then obtained for me a post in the
&lsquo;Refuge for the Aged;&rsquo; about the dullest place in all
Vienna.&nbsp; I was too young to be one of the members, so they
gave me a birth, where I did nothing.&nbsp; But what was the use
of that?&nbsp; I could not live among that company of <!-- page
119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>mumbling, bible-backed old people; and if I could, it
was all the same, for they kicked me out at the end of a month
for impropriety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky for me that I tumbled into a legacy about
this time, of eighty gulden m&uuml;nz.&nbsp; I enjoyed myself
while it lasted, and never troubled my brother with my
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did not last long; for, what with drinking beer, and
wearing fine clothes, and taking a dashing lodging on the Glacis,
I found my eighty guldens gone, just as I was in a position to
enjoy them most.&nbsp; But I was never very proud; so, seeing
that there was nothing to be done, but to go without beer, or to
humble myself to my brother, the rath, I chose the latter course
as the most reasonable, and made my peace with him at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you suppose he did for me?&nbsp; He said I
had disgraced myself and him at all the other places, so he could
do nothing but send me to the &lsquo;Asylum for the
Indigent.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I did not stay there long.&nbsp; There
was no beer there; nothing but thin soup and rind-fleish (fresh
boiled beef) all the year round.&nbsp; And a pretty lot of
ill-bred, miserable ignoramuses they were&mdash;the
indigent!&nbsp; Not a spark of life or jollity in the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I coolly walked out of the
&lsquo;Asylum,&rsquo; made off to a house I well knew, and ran up
a credit account in my brother&rsquo;s name of good eight guldens
for beer and tobacco.&nbsp; A glorious day! for I forgot all
about the &lsquo;asylum,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;indigent,&rsquo;
and every mortal pain and trouble in this inconvenient world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was awakened from a deep dream by a heavy hand on my
shoulder, and a loud voice in my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Holloa! friend Lech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired I,
gaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get up, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll know that soon enough; I am a
police officer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And where am I, in God&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, lying on your back, on the open
Glacis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was pleasant, was it not?&nbsp; So they took me to
the police-bureau, in the first case, for lying out in the open
air; and when they found that I had used my brother&rsquo;s name
to incur a debt, without his permission, they gave me two months
for fraudulent intentions.</p>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why did you not stay at the
&ldquo;Bounty?&rdquo;&rsquo; expostulated my friend, the
police-assistant, as we were talking the matter over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because it was too aristocratic and
uncomfortable,&rsquo; answered I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps the Rathherr, your brother, will be able
to get you into the &ldquo;Refuge,&rdquo;&rsquo; said he, in a
consoling way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God bless you! they have kicked me out of there
long ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I know of nothing but the
&ldquo;Indigent&rdquo; left for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My worthy friend,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that is
the very last place I came from.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was determined to be revenged.&nbsp; When my time
was expired, I sallied forth with my mind fully made up as to
what I was to do.&nbsp; I knew the hour when my brother, in
pursuance of his duties, usually entered the magistrate&rsquo;s
office, and, attired as I was&mdash;look at me! just as I am
now&mdash;in this old coat, the souvenir of the
&lsquo;Indigent,&rsquo; and these free-and-easy slippers, I
waited at the great entrance of the Magistracy, to pay my
respects to my brother, the Rath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him coming; and, as soon as he reached the foot
of the flight of stone steps, I marched forward, gave him a mock
salute, and exclaimed, in a loud voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morning, brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the meaning of this?&rsquo; demanded
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, brother!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;look
at this coat, and these shoes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Remove this fellow!&rsquo; exclaimed he to the
police, who were standing at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew what would be the result, but had determined to
have the play out.&nbsp; So I drew off my slipper, and, thrusting
my hand right through the hole at the toe, I made a bit of play
with my fingers, and shouted in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look at this, brother.&nbsp; Are you not ashamed
to see me?&nbsp; Look here!&nbsp; Look at this kripple-gespiel
(puppet show)!&nbsp; Look!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I was laid hold of; and here I am for another
two months, for insulting a city functionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story was received with a glee only equalled by the gusto
with which it was related.&nbsp; The last expression,
&ldquo;kripple-gespiel,&rdquo; was peculiarly his own.</p>
<p>Before leaving Vienna, about a month after my release, I had
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>determined to see the Br&uuml;hl, a wild, wooded, and
mountainous district, at a short distance from the city.&nbsp; We
had spent a delightful day among its thick pine woods, and on its
towering heights, and in the evening made our way to the small
town of M&ouml;dling, where we intended to take the railway to
Vienna.&nbsp; But there was a grand f&ecirc;te in the pleasure
grounds close to the town, accompanied by a magnificent display
of fireworks.&nbsp; This whiled away the time, and it was already
dark, as we at length bent our steps towards the railway
station.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice that I knew too well, struck upon my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity the poor blind!&rdquo; it exclaimed.</p>
<p>I turned, and behold! there was my one-eyed jail acquaintance,
planted against a brick wall, a stout staff, at least six feet
long, in his hand, and his apparently sightless eyes turned up to
the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity the poor blind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the greatest fear lest, even in his present blind
condition, he might recognise, and claim me as an acquaintance, I
hurried from the spot with all the speed of which I was capable,
and, thank Heaven, never set eyes upon him again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">a walk through a
mountain</span>.</p>
<p>I lately took a walk through the substance of a mountain,
entering at the top, and coming out at the bottom, after a two or
three mile journey underground.&nbsp; Perhaps the story of this
trip is worth narrating.&nbsp; The mountain was part of an
extensive property belonging to the Emperor of Austria, in his
character of salt merchant, and contained the famous salt mine of
Hallein.</p>
<p>The whole salt district of Upper Austria, called the
Salzkammergut, forms part of a range of rocks that extends from
Halle in the Tyrol, passes through Reichenthal in Bavaria, and
continues by way of Hallein in Salzburg, to end at Ausse in
Styria.&nbsp; The Austrian part of the range is now included in
what is called the <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>district of Salzburg, and that
district abounds, as might be expected, in salt springs, hot and
cold, which form in fact the baths of Gastein, Ischl, and some
other places.&nbsp; The names of Salzburg (Saltborough), the
capital, and of the Salzack (Saltbrook), on the left bank of
which that pleasant city stands, indicate clearly enough the
character of the surrounding country.&nbsp; Hallein is a small
town eight miles to the south-east of Salzburg, and it was to the
mine of Hallein, as before said, that I paid my visit.</p>
<p>On the way thither, we, a party of three foot-travellers,
passed through much delightful rock and water scenery.&nbsp; From
Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, we got through Wells and
Laimbach to the river Traun, and trudged afoot beside its winding
waters till we reached the point of its junction with the
Traunsee, or Lake of Traun.&nbsp; At Gmunden, we stopped to look
over the Imperial Salt Warehouses.&nbsp; The Emperor of Austria,
as most people know, is the only dealer in salt and tobacco with
whom his subjects are allowed to trade.&nbsp; His salt
warehouses, therefore, must needs be extensive.&nbsp; They are
situated at Gmunden to the left of the landing-place, from which
a little steamer plies across the lake; and they are so built as
to afford every facility for the unloading of boats that bring
salt barrels from the mine by the highway of the Traun.&nbsp; The
warehouses consisted simply of a large number of sheds piled with
the salt in barrels, a few offices, and a low but spacious hall,
filled, in a confused way, with dusty models.&nbsp; There were
models of river-boats and salt moulds, mining tools, and tram
ways, hydraulic models of all kinds, miniature furnaces, wooden
troughs, and seething pans.&nbsp; We looked through these until
the bell from the adjacent pier warned us, at five o&rsquo;clock
in the evening, to go on board the steamer that was quite ready
to puff and splash its way across the beautiful green lake.&nbsp;
We went under the shadow of the black and lofty Traunstien, and
among pine-covered rocks, of which the reflections were mingled
in the water with a ruddy glow, that streamed across a low shore
from some fires towards which we were steering.</p>
<p>The glow proceeded from the fires of the Imperial Saltern,
erected at Ebensee.&nbsp; We paid a short visit to the works,
which have been erected at great cost; and display all the most
recent improvements in the art of getting the best marketable
salt from saline water.&nbsp; We found that the water, heavily
impregnated, is conducted <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>from the
distant mines by wooden troughs into the drying pan.&nbsp; The
pan is a large shallow vessel of metal, supported by small piles
of brick, and a low brick wall about three feet high, extending
round two-thirds of its circumference; leaving one-third, as the
mouth of the furnace, open to the air.&nbsp; Among the brick
columns, and within the wall, the fire flashed and curled under
the seething pan.&nbsp; Ascending next into the house over the
great pan, and looking down upon the surface and its contents
through sliding doors upon the floors, we saw the white salt
crusting like a coat of snow over the boiling water, and being
raked, as it is formed, by workmen stationed at each of the trap
doors.&nbsp; As the water evaporated, the salt was stirred and
turned from rake to rake; and finally, when quite dry, raked into
the neighbourhood of a long-handled spade, with which one workman
was shovelling among the dried salt, and filling a long row of
wooden moulds, placed ready to his hand.&nbsp; These moulds are
sugar-loaf shaped, and perforated at the bottom like a sugar
mould, in order that any remaining moisture may drain out of
them.&nbsp; The moulds will be placed finally in a heated room
before the salt will be considered dry enough for storeage as a
manufactured article.</p>
<p>The brine that pours with an equable flow into the seething
pan at Ebensee, is brought by wooden troughs from the salt mine
at Hallein, a distance of thirty miles in a direct line.&nbsp; It
comes by way of mountains and along a portion of the valley of
the Traun, through which we continued our journey the same
evening from Ebensee, until the darkness compelled us to rest for
the night at a small inn on a hill side.&nbsp; The next day we
went through Ischl and Wolfgang, and spent three hours of
afternoon in climbing up the Scharfberg, which is more than a
thousand feet higher than Snowdon, to see the sunset and the
sunrise.&nbsp; There was sleeping accommodation on the top: so
there is on the top of Snowdon.&nbsp; On the Scharfberg we had a
hay-litter in a wooden shed, and ate goat&rsquo;s cheese and
bread and butter.&nbsp; We saw neither sunset nor sunrise, but
had a night of wind and rain, and came down in the morning
through white mist within a rugged gully ploughed up by the rain,
to get a wholesome breakfast at St. Gilgen on the lake.&nbsp;
More I need not say about the journey than that, on the fifth day
after leaving Ebensee, having rested a little in the very
beautiful city of Salzburg, we marched into the town of Hallein,
at the foot of the D&uuml;rrnberg, the famous salt mountain,
called Tumal by old chroniclers, <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and known
for a salt mountain seven hundred and thirty years ago.</p>
<p>After a night&rsquo;s rest in the town, we were astir by five
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and went forward on our visit to
the mines.&nbsp; In the case of the D&uuml;rrnberg salt mine, as
I have already said, the miner enters at the top and comes out at
the bottom.&nbsp; Our first business, therefore, was to walk up
the mountain, the approach to which is by a long slope of about
four English miles.</p>
<p>We met few miners by the way, and noticed in them few
peculiarities of manners or costume.&nbsp; The national dress
about these regions is a sort of cross between the Swiss Alpine
costume and a common peasant dress of the lowlands.&nbsp; We saw
indications of the sugar-loafed hat; jackets were worn almost by
all, with knee-breeches and coloured leggings.&nbsp; The clothing
was always neat and sound, and the clothed bodies looked
reasonably healthy, except that they had all remarkably pale
faces.&nbsp; The miners did not seem bodily to suffer from their
occupation.</p>
<p>As we approached the summit of the D&uuml;rrnberg, the dry
brownish limestone showed its bare front to the morning
sun.&nbsp; We entered the offices, partly contained in the rock,
and applied for admission into the dominion of the gnomes.&nbsp;
Our arrival was quite in the nick of time, for we had not to be
kept waiting, as we happened to complete the party of twelve,
without which the guides do not start.&nbsp; It was a Tower of
London business; and, as at the Tower, the demand upon our purses
was not very heavy.&nbsp; One gulden-schein&mdash;about
tenpence&mdash;is the regulated fee.&nbsp; Our full titles having
been duly put down in the register, each of us was furnished with
a miner&rsquo;s costume, and, so habited, off we set.</p>
<p>We started from a point that is called the
Obersteinberghauptstollen; our guides only having candles, one in
advance, the other in the rear.</p>
<p>We were sensible of a pleasant coldness in the air when we had
gone a little way into the sloping tunnel.&nbsp; The tunnel was
lofty, wide, and dry.&nbsp; Having walked downwards on a gentle
decline for a distance of nearly three thousand feet through the
half gloom and among the echoes, we arrived at the mouth of the
first shaft, named Freudenberg.&nbsp; The method of descent is
called the &ldquo;Rolle.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is both simple and
efficacious.&nbsp; Down the steep slope of the shaft, and at an
angle, in this case, of forty-one and a half degrees, runs a
smooth railway consisting of two pieces of timber, each of about
the <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>thickness of a scaffold pole; they
are twelve inches apart, and run together down the shaft like two
sides of a thick ladder without the intervening rounds.&nbsp;
Following the directions and example of the foremost guide, we
sat astride, one behind the other, on this wooden tramway, and
slid very comfortably to the bottom.&nbsp; The shaft itself was
only of the width necessary to allow room for our passage.&nbsp;
In this way we descended to the next chamber in the mountain, at
a depth of a hundred and forty feet (perpendicular) from the top
of the long slide.</p>
<p>We then stood in a low-roofed chamber, small enough to be
lighted throughout by the dusky glare of our two candles.&nbsp;
The walls and roof sparkled with brown and purple colours,
showing the unworked stratum of rock-salt.&nbsp; We stood then at
the head of the Untersteinberghauptstulm, and after a glance back
at the narrow slit in the solid limestone through which we had
just descended, we pursued our way along a narrow gallery of
irregular level for a further distance of six hundred and sixty
feet.&nbsp; A second shaft there opened us a passage into the
deeper regions of the mine.&nbsp; With a boyish pleasure we all
seated ourselves again upon a &ldquo;Rolle&rdquo;&mdash;this time
upon the Johann-Jacob-berg-rolle, which is laid at an angle of
forty-five and a half degrees&mdash;and away we slipped to the
next level, which is at the perpendicular depth of another couple
of hundred feet.</p>
<p>We alighted in another chamber where our candles made the same
half gloom, with their ruddy glare into the darkness, and where
there was the same sombre glittering upon the walls and
ceiling.&nbsp; We pursued our track along a devious cutting,
haunted by confused and giant shadows, suddenly passing black
cavernous sideways that startled us as we came upon them, and I
began to expect mummies, for I thought myself for one minute
within an old Egyptian catacomb.&nbsp; After traversing a further
distance of two thousand seven hundred feet we halted at the top
of the third slide, the K&ouml;nigsrolle.&nbsp; That shot us
fifty-four feet deeper into the heart of the mountain.&nbsp; We
had become quite expert at our exercise, and had left off
considering, amid all these descents and traverses, what might be
our real position in the bowels of the earth.&nbsp; Perhaps we
might get down to Aladdin&rsquo;s garden and find trees loaded
with emerald and ruby fruits.&nbsp; It was quite possible, for
there was something very cabalistic, very strong of enchantment
in the word Konhauserankehrschachtricht, the name given to the
portion of the <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>mine which we were then
descending.&nbsp; Konhauser-return-shaft is, I think, however,
about the meaning of that compound word.</p>
<p>So far we had felt nothing like real cold, although I had been
promised a wintry atmosphere.&nbsp; Possibly with a miner&rsquo;s
dress over my ordinary clothing, and with plenty of exercise,
there was enough to counteract the effects of the chill
air.&nbsp; But our eyes began to ache at the uncertain light, and
we all straggled irregularly along the smooth cut shaft level for
another sixty feet, and so reached the Konhauser-rolle, the
fourth slide we had encountered in our progress.</p>
<p>That cheered us up a little, as it shot us down another one
hundred and eight feet perpendicular depth to the
Soolererzeugungswerk-Konhauser&mdash;surely a place nearer than
ever to the magic regions of Abracadabra.&nbsp; If not
Aladdin&rsquo;s garden, something wonderful ought surely by this
time to have been reached.&nbsp; I was alive to any sight or
sound, and was excited by the earnest whispering of my fellow
adventurers, and the careful directions as to our progress given
by the guides and light-bearers.</p>
<p>With eager rapidity we flitted among the black shadows of the
cavern, till we reached a winding flight of giant steps.&nbsp; We
mounted them with desperate excitement, and at the summit halted,
for we felt that there was space before our faces, and had been
told that those stairs led to a mid mountain lake, nine hundred
and sixty feet below the mountain&rsquo;s top; two hundred and
forty feet above its base.&nbsp; Presently, through the darkness,
we perceived at an apparently interminable distance a few dots of
light, that shed no lustre, and could help us in no way to pierce
the pitchy gloom of the great cavern.&nbsp; The lights were not
interminably distant, for they were upon the other shore, and
this gnome lake is but a mere drop of water in the mountain mass,
its length being three hundred and thirty, and its breadth one
hundred and sixty feet.</p>
<p>Our guides lighted more candles, and we began to see their
rays reflected from the water; we could hear too the dull
splashing of the boat, which we could not see, as old Charon
slowly ferried to our shore.&nbsp; More lights were used; they
flashed and flickered from the opposite ferry station, and we
began to have an indistinct sense of a spangled dome, and of an
undulating surface of thick, black water, through which the
coming boat loomed darkly.&nbsp; More candles were lighted on
both sides of the Konhauser lake, a very Styx, defying all the
illuminating force of candles; dead and dark in its <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>dim cave, even the limits of which all our lights did
not serve to define.&nbsp; The boat reached the place of
embarcation, and we, wandering ghosts, half walked and were half
carried into its broad clumsy hulk, and took each his allotted
seat in ghostly silence.&nbsp; There was something really
terrible in it all; in the slow funereal pace at which we floated
across the subterranean lake; in the dead quiet among us, only
interrupted by the slow plunge of the oar into the sickly
waters.&nbsp; In spite of all the lights that had been kindled we
were still in a thick vapour of darkness, and could form but a
dreamy notion of the beauty and the grandeur of the crystal dome
within which we men from the upper earth were hidden from our
fellows.&nbsp; The lights were flared aloft as we crept
sluggishly across the lake, and now and then were flashed back
from a hanging stalactite, but that was all.&nbsp; The misty
darkness about us brought to the fancy at the same time fearful
images, and none of us were sorry when we reached the other shore
in safety.&nbsp; There a rich glow of light awaited us, and there
we were told a famous tale about the last Arch-ducal visit to
these salt mines, where some thousands of lighted tapers
glittered and flashed about him, and exhibited the vaulted roof
and spangled lake in all their beauty.&nbsp; As we were not
Archdukes, we had our Hades lighted only by a pound of short
sixteens.</p>
<p>We left the lake behind us, and then, traversing a further
distance of seventy feet along the Wehrschachtricht, arrived at
the mouth of the Konhauser Stiege.&nbsp; Another rapid descent of
forty-five feet at an angle of fifty degrees, and we reached
Rupertschachtricht, a long cavern of the extent of five hundred
and sixty feet, through which we toiled with a growing sense of
weariness.&nbsp; We had now come to the top of the last and
longest &ldquo;slide&rdquo; in the whole D&uuml;rrnberg.&nbsp; It
is called the Wolfdietrichberg-rolle, and is four hundred and
sixty-eight feet long, carrying us two hundred and forty feet
lower down into the mountain.&nbsp; We went down this
&ldquo;slide&rdquo; with the alacrity of school-boys, one after
another keeping the pot boiling, and all regulating our movements
with great circumspection, for we knew that we had far to go and
we could never see more than a few yards before us.</p>
<p>Having gained the ground beneath in safety, our attention was
drawn to a fresh water well or spring, sunk in this spot at great
cost by order of the Archduke, and blessed among miners.&nbsp;
Amid all the stone and salt and brine, a gush of pure fresh water
at our feet was very welcome to us all.&nbsp; The well was sunk,
however, to get <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>water that was necessary for the
mining operations.&nbsp; We did not see any of those operations
underground, for they are not exhibited; the show-trip
underground is only among the ventilating shafts and
galleries.&nbsp; Through the dark openings by which we had
passed, we should have found our way (had we been permitted) to
the miners.&nbsp; I have seen them working in the Tyrol, and
their labours are extremely simple.&nbsp; Some of the rock-salt
is quarried in transparent crystals, which undergo only the
process of crushing before they are sent into the market as an
article of commerce.&nbsp; Very little of this grain salt is seen
in England, but on the continent it may be found in some of the
first hotels, and on the table of most families.&nbsp; It is
cheaper than the loaf salt, and is known in Germany under the
title of <i>salzkorn</i>, and in France, as <i>selle de
cuisine</i>.&nbsp; In order to obtain a finer grained and better
salt, it is necessary that the original salt-crystals should be
dissolved, and for this purpose parallel galleries are run into
the rock, and there is dug in each of them a dyke or
cistern.&nbsp; These dykes are then flushed with water, which is
allowed to remain in them undisturbed for the space of from five
to twelve months, according to the richness of the soil; and,
being then thoroughly saturated with the salt that it has taken
up, the brine is drawn off through wooden pipes from Hallein over
hill and dale into the evaporating pans.</p>
<p>We had traversed the last level, and had reached what is
generally called the end of the salt-mine; but we were still a
long way distant from the pure air and the sunshine.&nbsp; We had
travelled through seven galleries of an aggregate length of
nearly two miles; we had floated across an earthy piece of water;
had followed one another down six slides, and had penetrated to
the depth of twelve hundred feet into the substance of the
mountain limestone, gypsum, and marl.&nbsp; Having done all this,
there we were, in the very heart of the D&uuml;rrnberg, left by
our guides, and intrusted to the care of two lank lads with
haggard faces.&nbsp; We stood together in a spacious cavern,
poorly lighted by our candles; there was a line of tram-rail
running through the middle of it, and we soon saw the carriage
that was to take us out of the mountain emerging from a dark nook
in the distance.&nbsp; It was a truck with seats upon it,
economically arranged after the fashion of an Irish jaunting
car.&nbsp; The two lads were to be our horses, and our way lay
through a black hollow in one side of the cavern, into which the
tram-rail ran.</p>
<p>We took our seats, instructed to sit perfectly still, and to
restrain <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>our legs and arms from any
straggling.&nbsp; There was no room to spare in the shaft we were
about to traverse.&nbsp; Our car was run on to the tram-line, and
the two lads, with a sickly smile, and a broad hint at their
expected gratuity, began to pull, and promised us a rapid
journey.&nbsp; In another minute we were whirring down an incline
with a rush and a rattle, through the subterranean passage
tunnelled into the solid limestone which runs to the outer edge
of the D&uuml;rrnberg.&nbsp; The length of this tunnel is
considerably more than an English mile.</p>
<p>The reverberation and the want of light were nothing, but we
were disagreeably sensible of a cloud of fine stone dust, and
knew well that we should come out not only stone deaf, but as
white as millers.&nbsp; Clinging to our seats with a cowardly
instinct, down we went through a hurricane of sound and
dust.&nbsp; At length we were sensible of a diminution in our
speed, and the confusion of noises so far ceased, that we could
hear the panting of our biped cattle.&nbsp; Then, straight before
us, shining in the centre of the pitchy darkness, there was a
bright blue star suddenly apparent.&nbsp; One of the poor lads in
the whisper of exhaustion, and between his broken pantings for
breath, told us that they always know when they have got half way
by the blue star, for that is the daylight shining in.</p>
<p>A little necessary rest, and we were off again, the blue star
before us growing gradually paler, and expanding and still
growing whiter, till with an uncontrollable dash, and a
concussion, we are thrown within a few feet of the broad
incomparable daylight.&nbsp; With how much contempt of candles
did I look up at the noonday sun!&nbsp; The two lads, streaming
with perspiration, who had dragged us down the long incline, were
made happy by the payment we all gladly offered for their
services.&nbsp; Then, as we passed out of the mouth of the shaft,
by a rude chamber cut out of the rock, we were induced to pause
and purchase from a family of miners who reside there a little
box of salt crystals, as a memento of our visit.&nbsp; Truly we
must have been among the gnomes, for when I had reached the inn I
spread the brilliant crystals I had brought home with me on my
bedroom window sill, and there they sparkled in the sun and
twinkled rainbows, changing and shifting their bright colours as
though there were a living imp at work within.&nbsp; But when I
got up next morning and looked for my crystals, in the place
where each had stood, I found only a little slop of brine.&nbsp;
That fact may, I have <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>no doubt, be accounted for by the
philosophers; but I prefer to think that it was something
wondrous strange, and that I fared marvellously like people of
whom I had read in German tales, how they received gifts from the
good people who live in the bowels of the earth, and what became
of them.&nbsp; I have had my experiences, and I do not choose to
be sure whether those tales are altogether founded upon
fancy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">cause and
effect</span>.</p>
<p>One September evening we rode into Carlsruhe.&nbsp; We made
our entry in a crazy hackney cab behind a lazy horse that had
been dragging us for a long time with cheerless industry between
a double file of trees, along a road without a bend in it; a
long, lanky, Quaker road, heavily drab-coated with dust; a
tight-rope of a road that comes from Manheim, and is hooked on to
the capital of Baden.&nbsp; Out of that <i>all&eacute;e</i> we
were dragged into the square-cut capital itself, which had
evidently been planned by the genius of a ruler&mdash;not a
prince, but the wooden measure.&nbsp; The horse stopped at the
City of Pfortzheim, and as his decision on the subject of our
halting-place appeared to be irrevocable, we got out.</p>
<p>At the capital of a grand dukedom, except Weimar, it is better
to sleep (it is the only thing to be done there) and pass on; but
it so happened that on that particular evening Carlsruhe was in a
ferment: there was something brewing.&nbsp; I heard talk of a
procession and of certain names, particularly the names
Kugelblitz and Thalermacher.&nbsp; Never having heard those names
before, and caring therefore nothing in the world about them, I
tumbled into bed.&nbsp; To my delight, when I got up in the
morning, I found the little town turned upside down.&nbsp;
Landlord, boots, and chambermaid, overwhelmed me with
exclamations, surmises, and incoherent summaries of the
night&rsquo;s news.&nbsp; There had been an outbreak.&nbsp;
<i>Lieber Herr</i>, a revolution!&nbsp; One entire house razed to
the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hep! hep!&rdquo; that is the old cry,
&ldquo;Down with the Jews!&rdquo;&nbsp; All their bones would
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>be made powder of.&nbsp; Tremendous funeral of
Kugelblitz.&nbsp; Students on their way in a body from
Heidelberg.&nbsp; Thalermacher the rich Jew, soldiers, the entire
court, Meinheer, all in despair; a regular sack.&nbsp; Not only
Kugelblitz, but Demboffsky, the Russian officer, killed.&nbsp; O
hep! hep! a lamentable tragedy.&nbsp; &ldquo;For they were two
such fine-looking young men,&rdquo; mourned the chambermaid,
&ldquo;especially Demboffsky.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had
better,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;stay in Carlsruhe till
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roused by the incoherent tidings, I hurried to the centre of
the tumult.&nbsp; The house of the firm of Thalermacher and
Company was situated in the High Street; and though, certainly,
it had a doleful look, it was there situated still: it held its
ground.&nbsp; Not a brick was displaced; but&mdash;gaunt and
windowless, disfigured with great blotches of ink and dirt, its
little shop rent from the wall and split up into faggots&mdash;it
looked like a house out of which all life had been knocked; but
there was the carcase.&nbsp; In the street before the house,
there were by that time a few splinters of furniture remaining;
the rest had been broken up or hidden by kind and cunning
neighbours.&nbsp; The shop had been cobbled together with the
broken shutters; and half-a-dozen soldiers, quite at their ease,
were lounging pleasantly about the broken door.</p>
<p>The outbreak, I was told by the bystanders, was quite
unpremeditated.&nbsp; A few stragglers had halted before the
house at about eight o&rsquo;clock on the preceding evening, and
had been discussing there the dreadful tale connected with its
owner.&nbsp; One gossip, in a sudden burst of anger, hurled a
bottle of ink&mdash;then by chance in his hand&mdash;at the
Jew&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The idea was taken up with such good
will that a hard rain of stones, bottles, and other missiles was
soon pelting against Thalermacher&rsquo;s walls.&nbsp; Where all
are unanimous it is not difficult to come to a conclusion.&nbsp;
An hour&rsquo;s labour, lightened by yells and shouts of
&ldquo;Hep, hep!&rdquo; was enough; and, the zeal of the people
burning like a fire, soon left of the house nothing but its
shell.</p>
<p>The authorities in Germany, usually so watchful and so prompt
to interfere, were either taken completely off their guard, or
tacitly permitted the rude work of vengeance; for, although there
was a guard-post in the immediate vicinity, the whole efforts of
the military were confined to conducting Thalermacher and his
family into a place of safety.&nbsp; The protection Thalermacher
received was of a peculiar kind.&nbsp; Under the plea of insuring
him against public <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>attack, he was conducted under
escort, to the fortress of Rastadt, and there held a close
prisoner, until the whole affair could be investigated.</p>
<p>The funeral procession of Lieutenant Kugelblitz was not a
thing to be missed.&nbsp; I went, therefore, to the other end of
the city, whence the procession was to start.&nbsp; The scene was
impressive.&nbsp; Not merely his brothers-in-arms of the
artillery, but the general-staff&mdash;all the officers of
distinction in the Baden army, whose duties allowed them to be
present&mdash;and even the Russian companions of his antagonist
Demboffsky, acted as mourners.</p>
<p>As the procession came before the house of Thalermacher, I
observed that a strong guard had been posted there for its
protection.&nbsp; The funeral passed by without any demonstration
whatever.&nbsp; Presently we turned up a narrow passage, leading
from the high street towards the cemetery, and our progress
became tediously slow as we moved with the close mass of
people.&nbsp; At the burial-place every mound and stone was
occupied.&nbsp; Flowers were trampled under foot, shrubs broken
or uprooted, and the grass all stamped into the mould.&nbsp; The
whole crowd listened to the impressive tone&mdash;only a few
could hear the words&mdash;of the funeral harangue, and to the
solemn hymn which followed.&nbsp; The service closed with the
military honour of musketry fired over the soldier&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; That over, I was sucked back by the retreating tide
of citizens into the main street of Carlsruhe.</p>
<p>The crowd instantly dispersed; and, as I wandered through the
side streets, I soon saw that the authorities had come to
life.&nbsp; My attention was first called to an official
announcement freshly posted, which warned all persons from
assembling in the public street in knots or clusters, even of
three or four, on pain of being instantly dispersed by the
military.&nbsp; Another placard fulminated an injunction to
parents, masters, and burghers to restrain and confine all
persons under their charge&mdash;such as workmen, servants, and
children&mdash;within their respective houses; because, for any
offence committed by them against the public peace, such masters
or parents would be held responsible.&nbsp; I began to fancy
myself in a state of siege.&nbsp; Wandering again into the main
street I was met by a strong division of dusty dragoons, in full
equipment of war, which came sweeping and clashing along from
adjacent parts of the country, evidently under urgent
orders.&nbsp; Another and another followed.&nbsp; Troops of
infantry tramped hastily along the side streets.&nbsp; The very
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>few civilians I met in the streets seemed to be
hurrying to shelter from a coming storm.&nbsp; Was there really
any social tempest in the wind?&nbsp; Or were all these
precautions but a locking of the stable door after the steed was
stolen?</p>
<p>Having roamed by chance into a sequestered beer-house, I was
surprised to find myself in the midst of a large party of
students; probably from Heidelberg.&nbsp; They were well-grown
youths, with silken blond beards; and in their behaviour,
half-swaggerers, half-gentlemen.&nbsp; These were, perhaps, the
enemies of order against whom the tremendous military
preparations had been made.</p>
<p>As the day wore on it became evident that the authorities were
ready to brave the most overwhelming revolution that ever burst
forth.&nbsp; Troop after troop of cavalry galloped in; every
soldier, indeed, of whatever arm stationed within an available
distance of Carlsruhe, was brought within its walls.&nbsp; By
eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening the military preparations were
completed: a picket of infantry was stationed at every street
corner; and, from that hour to the break of day, parties of
dragoons swept the main thoroughfares, clashing and clattering
over the paved road with a din that kept me awake all
night.&nbsp; Intercourse between one street and another, except
on urgent business, was interdicted; and the humblest pedestrian
found abroad without an urgent errand was conducted home with
drums beating, colours flying, and all the honours of war.&nbsp;
The display of force answered its purpose in preventing a second
attack of Christians on Jews.&nbsp; The pale ghost of
insubordination was laid and dared not walk
abroad&mdash;especially at night.</p>
<p>I must say I felt a little relieved when it was ascertained
for certain that the city was safe.&nbsp; I am no friend to
despotism nor to political thraldom of any kind; but really it is
impossible not to feel for the solemn aristocracies of German
Grand-Duchies (who, if they be despots, are extremely amiable)
when, poor people, they are in the least put out of their way:
they are so dreadfully fussy, so fearfully piteous, so
distraught, so inconsolable.&nbsp; I was glad therefore that, the
revolution being put down, they could retire in peace to their
coffee, their picquet, and their metaphysics.&nbsp; Doubtless
Thalermacher (some Hebrew millionaire, perhaps) and Kugelblitz (a
fire-eater, for certain) had headed a frightful band of
anarchists; who, but for the indomitable energy of the
authorities, would peradventure have changed the destiny of the
entire Duchy, of Germany, of Europe itself!&nbsp; Nothing but so
illimitable an <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>apprehension could have been the
cause of such a siege-like effect.&nbsp; What else could have
occasioned the entire blockade of Carlsruhe?</p>
<p>I had, however, exaggerated the cause as well as the danger;
and I will now relate the real circumstances which had led to all
these awful results; for the facts were afterwards made known in
the Carlsruhe and Baden-Baden public journals of the day.</p>
<p>Early in the month of August, eighteen hundred and
forty-three, the inhabitants of Baden-Baden gave a ball in honour
of the Grand-Princess Helene of Baden, and the Duchess of
Nassau.&nbsp; Among the names on the subscription-list stood that
of Herr Heller von Thalermacher.&nbsp; Some unexplained animosity
existed between this gentleman and Lieutenant Kugelblitz, who was
also one of the subscribers.</p>
<p>Baron Donner von Kugelblitz, chief lieutenant of the Baden
artillery, although only in his twenty-ninth year, had already
spent fourteen years in military service, and was highly esteemed
for his soldierly qualities and straightforward bearing.&nbsp; He
was tall, remarkably handsome, of an impetuous temperament, and
his natural strength had been well developed by constant practice
in manly and athletic exercises.&nbsp; Herr Heller von
Thalermacher, or rather the firm of which he was the prominent
member, was distinguished for qualities far different, but
equally deserving of goodwill.&nbsp; The banking-house of
Thalermacher was one of the most responsible in South Germany;
and, at great expense and sacrifice, had introduced into the
grand, but by no means affluent, duchy of Baden several branches
of industry, which had enriched the ducal treasury, and furnished
employment for thousands of industrious subjects.&nbsp; It had
revived the almost extinguished mining interest; had introduced
extensive spinning machinery; and had established a factory for
the manufacture of beetroot sugar.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Kugelblitz, to whose opinion deference was due,
expressed himself in such offensive terms with respect to Herr
von Thalermacher, in relation to the ball, that the gentlemen who
had prepared the subscription-list at once erased the
objectionable name: Herr von Thalermacher at once demanded
satisfaction from his accuser, but this Lieutenant Kugelblitz
refused, on the ground that the banker was not respectable enough
for powder and shot.&nbsp; Hereupon two courts of honour were
formed, one composed of gentlemen civilians in Baden-Baden, and
the other of the officers in Carlsruhe.&nbsp; Both appeared to
have been called together at the wish <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of
Lieutenant Kugelblitz, to inquire into and pronounce upon the
point at issue.&nbsp; The civilians came to no decision.&nbsp;
The military court of honour put the result of its deliberations
in the <i>Carlsruhe Zeitung</i>, as a public advertisement,
couched in these terms: &ldquo;The Herr von Kugelblitz may not
fight with the Herr von Thalermacher.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus posted as
a scamp, Thalermacher advertised back his own defence; and, by
public circulars and bills, declared the accusation of Kugelblitz
to be false and malicious, and his behaviour dishonourable and
cowardly.&nbsp; At the same time, a Russian officer of good
family,&mdash;Demboffsky&mdash;who had acted throughout as
negotiator and friend on the part of Thalermacher, and who felt
himself deeply compromised by the imputations put forth against
his principal, declared publicly that the military court which
had condemned the Herr von Thalermacher, after hearing only his
accuser, was a one-sided and absurd tribunal, and that it was not
competent to give any decision.</p>
<p>The result of this declaration was a challenge from Lieutenant
Kugelblitz.&nbsp; Demboffsky said that he was quite willing to
give his challenger the satisfaction he demanded, on condition
that he should first arrange his quarrel with Herr Thalermacher,
as became a gentleman.</p>
<p>On the night of the first of September (at the beginning of
our English shooting season), the Russian being on a visit to his
friend Thalermacher, in his apartments, assured him in the most
positive terms that he would keep promise, and would make no
hostile arrangement with Lieutenant Kugelblitz.&nbsp; Prince
Trubetzkoi and other friends then present completely coincided in
this mode of action.&nbsp; At half-past eleven at night,
Demboffsky quitted his friend, and hastened homewards.&nbsp; Be
had advanced only a few steps on the road, when suddenly two
figures strode up to him, and stayed his progress.&nbsp; He at
once recognised Kugelblitz, and a Spaniard named Manillo, who had
lived for many years in Germany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you fight with me?&rdquo; shouted Kugelblitz in a
passion.</p>
<p>The Russian, although taken completely by surprise, replied
that he would do as he had already said.&nbsp; He would fight
with Senor Manillo at once if it were thought desirable; but he
would engage in no hostilities with Kugelblitz, until the quarrel
with Thalermacher was adjusted.&nbsp; Great was the wrath of
Kugelblitz.&nbsp; He clenched his fist, shook it in the face of
Demboffsky, and demanded furiously that he should give his word
of honour to fight him in the <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>morning.&nbsp; The Russian, who expected bodily
violence, then said that since the insult had been pushed so far,
there remained no other course open to him, than to accept the
challenge; which he accordingly did, pledging himself to meet
Kugelblitz on the morrow.&nbsp; He then hastened back to his
friend Thalermacher, and related the occurrence to him.</p>
<p>On the following day the duel took place.&nbsp; It happened
that Lieutenant Kugelblitz was under orders to mark out the
artillery practice-ground at Hardwald, near Rastadt, and as he
could not leave his post, the meeting took place in its
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The two officers stood forward in deadly
opposition with a measured distance of ten paces only.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the first fire was without result; but, at the
second fire, Kugelblitz was struck in the breast; yet he still
held his weapon undischarged.&nbsp; He pressed his left hand on
the wound as he pulled the trigger with his right.&nbsp; The
pistol missed fire.&nbsp; Another cap was placed upon the nipple,
but it also failed.&nbsp; The second of Demboffsky then handed
another weapon to the dying man; who, with quiet resolution,
still closing his wound with his fingers, drew for the third time
upon his opponent, and with such effect, that, uttering a wild
cry, and the words &ldquo;<i>Je suis mort</i>!&rdquo; &ldquo;I am
dead!&rdquo; the Russian leapt up into the air, and then rolled
upon the ground a corpse.&nbsp; Kugelblitz, exhausted by the
efforts he had made to die like a gentleman, sank into the arms
of his second, Manillo, and was carried insensible to
Carlsruhe.&nbsp; He died at noon on the second day after the
duel.</p>
<p>Thereupon the discerning and indignant public, a little
biassed&mdash;as it too often has been in Germany&mdash;against
the Jews in general, gutted the house of Herr von
Thalermacher.</p>
<p>The state also fell in with the common notion; and, under the
plea of sheltering an injured man, lodged him in prison for
eleven days.&nbsp; Seals were also placed upon his papers and
apartments.&nbsp; The State then set about ascertaining privately
in how far the victim of mob law had been guilty of the mischief
which by general acclamation was imputed to him.</p>
<p>After a hunt through the banker&rsquo;s desk, and an
inspection of his drawers, the decision of the court tribunal of
Rastadt was delivered.&nbsp; It was ordered that the Herr Heller
von Thalermacher be forthwith liberated from the fortress of
Rastadt, free and untainted.&nbsp; Further: that the seals be
removed from his apartments and papers, <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>seeing that
nothing among them had been found which could cast the faintest
shadow upon his reputation.</p>
<p>We had all been yelling at the wrong man.&nbsp; Kugelblitz
was, after all, the author of the tragedy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">greece and her
deliverer</span>.</p>
<p>Four happy tramps in company, we passed the frontiers of
Austria and Bavaria, near Berchtesgaden, in the hazy shimmering
of an autumn morning sun.&nbsp; We came from the lakes and
mountain regions of Upper Austria, and already yearned towards
Munich, the Bavarian capital, as our next station and brief
resting place.&nbsp; The sun seemed to have melted into the air,
for we walked through it rather than beneath it, and sought in
vain for coolness and shelter among the plum trees which lined
the public road.&nbsp; Halting as the night closed in at the
frontier town, Reichenhall, with its quaint old streets, and its
distant fortress, casting a lengthened protective shadow over the
place, we felt the indescribable luxury of the
foot-traveller&rsquo;s rest; as readily enjoyed at such times on
a litter of straw in the common room of an alehouse as between
the cumbersome comforts of two German feather beds.&nbsp; Both
the ale and the feather beds were at our service at Reichenhall,
and we did not neglect them.</p>
<p>In the morning our road lay by sombre, romantic Traunstein,
and what was better still, by the glistening waters of the lake
of Chiem, whose broad surface was so unruffled, that the wide
expanse seemed to lie in a hollow, and a delicious coolness
whispered rather than blew across its tranquil waves.&nbsp; The
day was waning as we made a half circuit round the edge of the
lake, and the deepening night only stayed our steps and drove us
to rest, after a march of twenty-four miles, in the village of
Seebruck.&nbsp; At Rosenheim we were challenged by the Bavarian
sentinel, who held post on a stone bridge leading to the town,
but it was rather in kindliness than suspicion; and with some
useful information as to our route, and a cheering valediction,
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>we pursued our way.&nbsp; The villages of Weisham and
Aibling lay before us, and must be passed before night; and it
was in the immediate neighbourhood of these places, although I
confess to some indistinctness as to the precise locality, that
we came upon an object which at once surprised and delighted
us.</p>
<p>By the side of the road, on a slight elevation, stood a
beautiful stone monument, of the purest Grecian architecture, and
of the most delicate workmanship.&nbsp; It was fresh and sharp
from the chisel of the sculptor, and looked so stately and
graceful in the midst of the level landscape and simple village
scenery that we halted spontaneously to examine it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can it be the memorial of some battle?&rdquo; exclaimed
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or a devotional shrine?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or
a tomb?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not any one of these.&nbsp; Its purpose was
as singular as the sentiment it expressed would have been
beautiful and touching, but for its presumption.&nbsp; Graven
deeply into the stone were words in the German language to this
effect: &ldquo;This monument is raised in remembrance of the
parting of Louis, King of Bavaria, with his second son Otho, who
here left his bereaved father to become the Deliverer of
Greece.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we stood and read these words the vision
of the fond father and proud king, taking his last farewell of
the son whom he fondly believed destined to fulfil so great a
mission, floated before us, to be replaced the next instant by
the no less eloquent picture of the court of the then King Otho,
a German colony in the midst of the Greek people, living upon its
blood, and wantoning with its treasure; and of this same Greek
people, driven at length into fury by the rapacity of the hated
Tudesca, who filled every position of authority and grasped at
every office of emolument, and hunting them like a routed army
out of the land.&nbsp; Still there was a depth of paternal
affection in the words upon the monument, which impressed us with
respect, as the miniature temple, with its delicate columns and
classical proportions, had inspired us with admiration.</p>
<p>We pursued our way along the dull road, now halting a moment
to cool our fevered feet, now restlessly shifting our knapsacks
in the vain hope of lightening the burden, when, being in the
immediate neighbourhood of the village of Aibling, we came upon a
second monument equally classical in form, though of less
pretensions than the first.&nbsp; A twice-told tale, uttered this
time in a woman&rsquo;s accents; for the block of stone repeated
the same story in almost identical words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the Queen of Bavaria parted with her beloved
second son <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Otho, only comforted in her
affliction by the knowledge that he has left her to become the
Deliverer of Greece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hopes of the King and Queen of Bavaria, thus unluckily
commemorated by these monuments, were no less at that time the
hopes and the belief of all Europe&mdash;with what little of
prophetic spirit full twenty years of experience has shown.&nbsp;
Greece, swarming with Bavarian adventurers, till goaded to the
utmost she drove them from her bosom; Greece, bankrupt,
apathetic, and ungrateful; a Greek port blockaded by the ships of
her first defender, and her vessels held in pawn for the payment
of a miserable debt; Greece, piratical, dissembling, and
rebellious, aiding in her weak and greedy ambition the worst
enemy of Europe&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;but Greek
deliverance not yet.&nbsp; Her joint occupation by French and
English forces, and the possible imposition of a provisional
government, may indeed lead to the unprophesied
consummation&mdash;her deliverance&mdash;from King Otho.</p>
<p>No doubt, those monuments of mingled weakness and arrogance
still whiten in the air; as for us, we continued our march
towards the Bavarian capital, slept at a pilgrimage church that
night, and on the following morning made a bargain with the
driver of a country cart who had overtaken us, and seated on the
rough timber which formed his load, jolted into Munich.</p>
<p>King Louis then reigned in Bavaria, but being so indifferent a
prophet could not foresee his own speedy abdication.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">the french
workman</span>.</p>
<p>The original stuff out of which a French workman is made, is a
street boy of fourteen years old, or, perhaps, twelve.&nbsp; That
young <i>gamin de Paris</i> can sing as many love ditties and
drinking songs as there are hairs upon his head, before he knows
how much is nine times seven.&nbsp; He prefers always the
agreeable to the useful: he knows how to dance all the
quadrilles: he knows how to make grimaces of ten thousand sorts
one after the other without stopping, <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>and at the
rate of twenty in a minute.&nbsp; Of his other attainments, I say
little.&nbsp; It is possible that he may have been to one of the
elementary schools set up by the Government; or, it may be that
he knows not how to read; although, by Article 10 of a law passed
in eighteen hundred and thirty-three, it was determined that no
chief town of a department, or chief place of a commune,
containing more than six thousand inhabitants, should be without
at least one elementary school for public instruction.</p>
<p>Such as the boy may be, he is made an apprentice.&nbsp; He
needs no act, or, as you say in England, indenture.&nbsp; His
contract has to be attested at the Prefecture of Police, Bureau
of Passports, Section of Livrets.&nbsp; Formerly, it was the
custom in France for the apprentice to be both fed and lodged by
his master; but, as the patron seldom received money with him, he
was mainly fed on cuffs.&nbsp; Apprenticeship in Paris, which is
France, begins at ages differing according to the nature of the
trade.&nbsp; If strength be wanted, the youth is apprenticed at
eighteen, but otherwise, perhaps, at fourteen.&nbsp; There are in
Paris nineteen thousand apprentices dispersed among two hundred
and seventy branches of trade.</p>
<p>Of all the apprentices whose number has been just named, only
one in five is bound by a written agreement with his
master.&nbsp; The rest have a verbal understanding.&nbsp; The
youths commonly are restless; and, since they are apt to change
their minds, the business of the master is not so much to teach
them as to obtain value for himself as soon as he can out of
their labour.&nbsp; It is the apprentice who is sent out to take
orders in the town, and to play the part of messenger.&nbsp; In
consequence of the looseness of the tie, it often happens that a
thoughtless parent, when his son is able to earn wages, tells the
youth that his master is sucking him and fattening upon his
unpaid labour; that he might earn money for the house at
home.&nbsp; The youth is glad to earn, and throws up his
apprenticeship for independent work.&nbsp; It soon occurs to him
that his parents are sucking him, and that his earnings ought to
be for himself, and not for them.&nbsp; He then throws up his
home dependence, as he had thrown up dependence on his master,
takes a lodging, falls into careless company, and works on, a
half-skilled labourer, receiving all his life a less income than
he could have assured to himself by a few years of early
perseverance.</p>
<p>When I was apprentice, eight years ago, I found that to be a
good workman, it was needful to design and model.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>said my
comrade Gredinot, &ldquo;I will show you a good
school.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a winter evening; our work was over;
and, with leave of the patron, we left our shop in the Rue Saint
Martin, and went by Saint Saviour to the Rue Montorgueil.&nbsp;
We bought as we went about twelve pounds of modelling clay.&nbsp;
At the upper end of the street, my friend Gredinot turned up a
dark passage.&nbsp; I followed him.&nbsp; A single lamp glimmered
in the court to which it led us.&nbsp; We went up a few steps to
the schoolroom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Gredinot,
in opening the door.&nbsp; We entered, carrying our caps.&nbsp;
There was a low room lighted by flaring oil lamps; but in it were
busts and statues of such beauty that it seemed to me to be the
most delightful chamber in the world.&nbsp; Boys and youths and a
few men, all in blouses like ourselves, laboured there.&nbsp; We
threw our clay upon a public heap in a wooden trough near the
door.&nbsp; There was only that mud to pay, and there were our
own tools to take.&nbsp; Everything else was free.&nbsp; Gredinot
introduced me to the master, and I learnt to model from that
night.&nbsp; There are other schools&mdash;the school of Arts and
Trades in the Rue St. Martin, and the Special and Gratuitous
School of Design in the Rue du Tourraine, in connection, as I
think, with the School of Fine Arts.&nbsp; I might number the
museums and the libraries, and I may make mention also of the
prizes of the Academy of Industry and of the Society for the
Encouragement of National Industry.</p>
<p>The apprentice when out of his time goes to the prefecture of
police.&nbsp; There he must obtain a livret, which must have on
the face of it the seal of the prefecture, the full name of the
admitted workman, his age, his place of birth, and a description
of his person, his trade, and the name of the master who employs
him.&nbsp; The French workman is taboo, until he is registered by
the police and can produce his livret.&nbsp; The book costs him
twopence halfpenny.&nbsp; Its first entry is a record of the
completion of his apprenticeship.&nbsp; Afterwards every fresh
engagement must be set down in it, with the dates of its
beginning and its end, each stamped by the prefecture.&nbsp; The
employer of a workman holds his livret as a pledge.&nbsp; When he
receives money in advance, the sum is written in his book, and it
is a debt there chargeable as a deduction of not more than one
fifth upon all future employment, until it is paid.&nbsp; The
workman when travelling must have his livret <i>vis&eacute;d</i>;
for, without that, says the law, &ldquo;he is a vagabond, and can
be arrested and punished as such.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>The workman registered and livreted, how does he live,
work, and sleep?&nbsp; He is not a great traveller; for, unless
forced into exile, the utmost notion of travel that a French
workman has, is the removal&mdash;if he be a
provincial&mdash;from his native province to Paris.&nbsp; We pass
over the workman&rsquo;s chance of falling victim to the
conscription, if he has no friends rich enough to buy for him a
substitute, or if he cannot subscribe for the same object to a
Conscription Mutual Assurance Company.&nbsp; When Louis Blanc had
his own way in France the workmen did but ten hours&rsquo; labour
in the day.&nbsp; Now, however, as before, twelve or thirteen
hours are regarded as a fair day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; I and
Friponnet, who are diamond jewellers, work ten hours only.&nbsp;
My friend Cornichon, who is a goldsmith, works as long as a
painter or a smith.&nbsp; Sunday labour used to be very general
in France, but extended seldom beyond the half day; which was
paid for at a higher rate.&nbsp; In Paris seven in eight of us
used to earn money on the Sunday morning.&nbsp; That necessity
could not be pleaded for the act, is proved by the fact, that
often we did no work on Monday, but on that day spent the
Sunday&rsquo;s earnings.&nbsp; As for wages, calculated on an
average of several years, they are about as follows:&mdash;The
average pay for a day&rsquo;s labour is three shillings and
twopence.&nbsp; The lowest day&rsquo;s pay known is five pence,
and the highest thirty shillings.&nbsp; About thirty thousand of
us receive half-a-crown a day; five or six times as many (the
majority) receive some sum between half-a-crown and four and
twopence.&nbsp; About ten thousand receive higher wages.&nbsp;
The best wages are earned by men whose work is connected with
print, paper, and engraving.&nbsp; The workers in jewels and gold
are the next best provided for; next to them workers in metal and
in fancy ware.&nbsp; Workers on spun and woven fabrics get low
wages; the lowest is earned, as in London, by slop-workers and
all workers with the needle.&nbsp; The average receipts of Paris
needlewomen have not, however, fallen below fourteenpence a day;
those of them who work with fashionable dressmakers earn about
one and eightpence.&nbsp; While speaking of the ill-paid class of
women, I must mention that the most sentimental of our
occupations earns the least bread.&nbsp; Those who make crowns of
<i>immortelles</i> to hang upon the tombs, only earn about
sevenpence-halfpenny a day.&nbsp; That trade is, in very truth,
funereal.&nbsp; To come back to ourselves, it should be said that
our wages, as a whole, have risen rather than declined during
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>the last quarter of a century.&nbsp; It is a curious
fact, however, that the pay for job-work has decreased very
decidedly.</p>
<p>And how do we live? it is asked.&nbsp; Well enough.&nbsp; All
of us eat two meals a day; but what we eat depends upon our
money.&nbsp; We three, who draw up this account, work in one
room.&nbsp; We begin fasting, and maintain our fast until eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then we send the apprentice out to fetch our
breakfasts.&nbsp; When he comes back with his stores, he disposes
them neatly on a centre table in little groups.&nbsp; I generally
have a pennyworth of ham, which certainly is tough, but very full
of flavour; bread to the same value; a half share with Friponnet
in two-pennyworth of wine, and a half-pennyworth of fried
potatoes; thus spending in all threepence-halfpenny.&nbsp;
Cornichon spends the same sum generally in another way.&nbsp; He
has a pennyworth of cold boiled (unsalted) beef, a pennyworth of
bread, a halfpennyworth of cheese and a pennyworth of currant
jam.&nbsp; Friponnet is more extravagant.&nbsp; A common
breakfast bill of fare with him is two penny sausages,
twopennyworth of bread, a pennyworth of wine, a halfpenny
<i>paquet de couenne</i> (which is a little parcel of crisply
fried strips of bacon rind), and a baked pear.&nbsp; All this is
sumptuous; for we are of the aristocracy of workmen.&nbsp; The
labourers of Paris do not live so well.&nbsp; They go to the
<i>gargottes</i>, where they get threepence halfpennyworth of
bouilli&mdash;soup, beef and vegetable&mdash;which includes the
title to a liberal supply of bread.&nbsp; Reeking, dingy dens are
those <i>gargottes</i>, where all the poorer classes of Parisian
workmen save the beef out of their breakfast bouilli, and carry
it away to eat later in the day at the wine-shop; where it will
make a dinner with more bread and a pennyworth of wine.&nbsp; Of
bread they eat a great deal; and, reckoning that at fourpence and
the wine at a penny, we find eightpence to be the daily cost of
living to the great body of Parisian workmen.</p>
<p>We aristos among workpeople dine famously.&nbsp; My own
practice is to dine in the street du Petit Carr&eacute; upon
dinners for ninepence; or, by taking dinner-tickets for fourteen
days in advance, I get one dinner a fortnight given me
gratuitously.&nbsp; I dine upon soup, a choice of three plates of
meat, about half-a-pint of wine, a dessert and bread at
discretion.&nbsp; Our dinner hour is four o&rsquo;clock, and we
are not likely to eat anything more before bedtime; although one
of us may win a cup of coffee or a dram of brandy at billiards or
dominoes in the evening.&nbsp; Cornichon and Friponnet dine in
the street Chabannais; have soup at a penny a portion, small
plates of <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>meat at twopence each, dessert at a
penny, and halfpenny slips of bread.&nbsp; Each of us when he has
dined rolls up a cigarette, and lounges perhaps round the Palais
Royal for half an hour.</p>
<p>As for our lodging the poorest of us live by tens in one room,
and sleep by fours and fives upon one mattress; paying from
twopence to tenpence a night.&nbsp; The ordinary cost of such
lodging as the workman in Paris occupies is, for a whole room for
one person, nine or ten shillings a month; for more than one, six
or seven shillings each; and for half a bed, four
shillings.&nbsp; Cornichon lives in room number thirty-six on the
third floor of a furnished lodging house in the street du Petit
Lion.&nbsp; You must ring for the porter if you would go in to
Cornichon; and the porter must, by a jerk at a string, unlatch
the street door if Cornichon wishes to come out to you.&nbsp; In
a little court at the back are two flights of dirty stairs of red
tile edged with wood.&nbsp; They lead to distinct portions of the
house.&nbsp; Cornichon&rsquo;s room is paved with red tiles,
polished now and then with beeswax.&nbsp; It is furnished with
the bed and a few inches of bedside carpet, forming a small
island on the floor, with two chairs, a commode with a black
marble top, a washing-basin and a water-bottle.&nbsp; Cornichon
has also a cupboard there in which he stores his wood for winter,
paying twenty-pence per hundred pounds for logs; and as the room
contains no grate, he rents a German stove from his landlord,
paying four-and-two-pence for his use of it during the
season.</p>
<p>Friponnet rents two unfurnished rooms up four pair of stairs,
at the back of a house in the street d&rsquo;Argenteuil.&nbsp; He
pays ten shillings a month.&nbsp; They are furnished in mahogany
and black marble bought of a broker, and I think not paid for
yet.&nbsp; Fidette visits him there.&nbsp; She is a gold and
silver polisher, his <i>bonne amie</i>.&nbsp; She has her own
lodging; but she and Friponnet divide their earnings.&nbsp; They
belong to one another: although no priest has blessed their
voluntary contract.&nbsp; It is so, I am pained to say, with very
many of us.</p>
<p>I have a half-bed in a little street, with a man who is a good
fellow, considering he is a square-head&mdash;a German.&nbsp; The
red tiles of my staircase are very clean, and slippery with
beeswax.&nbsp; My landlord rents a portion of the third floor of
the house, and under-lets it fearfully.&nbsp; One apartment has
been penned off into four, and mine is the fourth section at the
end.&nbsp; To reach me one must pass through the first pen, which
is occupied by Monsieur and Madame.&nbsp; <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>There they
work, eat, and sleep; as for Madame, she never leaves it.&nbsp;
Monsieur only goes away to wait upon the <i>griffe</i>, his
master, when he wants more work; his <i>griffe</i> is a slop
tailor.&nbsp; Monsieur and Madame sleep in a recess, which looks
like a sarcophagus.&nbsp; A little Italian tailor also sleeps in
the same pen; but whereabouts I know not&mdash;his bed is a
mystery.&nbsp; The next pen is occupied by two carpenters, seldom
at home.&nbsp; When they come home, all of us know it; for they
are extremely musical.&nbsp; In the third pen live three more
tailors, through whose territory I must pass to my own
cabinet.&nbsp; But how snug that is!&nbsp; Although only eight
feet by ten, it has two corner windows; and, if there is little
furniture and but a scanty bed, there is a looking-glass fit for
a baron, and some remains of violet-coloured hangings and long
muslin curtains; either white or brown, I am not sure.&nbsp; I
and the German pay for this apartment fifteen shillings
monthly.</p>
<p>There is a kind of lodgers worth especial mention.&nbsp; The
men working in the yards of masons, carpenters, and
others&mdash;masons especially&mdash;frequently come from the
provinces.&nbsp; They are not part of the fixed population; but
are men who have left their wives and families to come up to the
town and earn a sum of money.&nbsp; For this they work most
energetically; living in the most abstemious manner, in order
that they may not break into their hoard.&nbsp; They occupy
furnished lodgings, flocking very much together.&nbsp; Thus the
masons from the departments of la Creuse and la Haute Vienne
occupy houses let out in furnished rooms exclusively to
themselves, in the quarters of the Hotel de Ville, the Arsenal,
Saint Marcel, and in other parts of Paris.&nbsp; The rigid
parsimony of these men is disappointed terribly when any crisis
happens.&nbsp; They are forced to eat their savings, to turn
their clothing and their tools into food, and, by the revolution
of eighteen hundred and forty-eight, were reduced to such great
destitution, that in some of the houses occupied by them one
dress was all that remained to all the lodgers.&nbsp; They wore
it in turn, one going out in it to seek for work while all the
rest remained at home in bed.&nbsp; The poor fellows thanked the
want of exercise for helping them to want of appetite&mdash;the
only kind of want that poverty desires.</p>
<p>These men, however, working in the great yards, eating their
meals near them in an irregular and restless way, form clubs and
associations which lead not seldom to strikes&mdash;blunders
which we call placing ourselves <i>en Gr&egrave;ve</i>.&nbsp;
They take the name <i>en Gr&egrave;ve</i> from <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the place
in which one class of builders&rsquo; workmen assemble when
waiting to be hired.&nbsp; Various places are chosen by sundry
workmen and workwomen for this practice of waiting to be
hired.&nbsp; Laundresses, for example, are to be found near the
church of our Lady of Lorette, where they endure, and too often
enjoy, coarse words from passers-by.</p>
<p>Except in the case of the masons and labourers from the
departments, it is to be regarded as no good sign when a workman
makes a residence of furnished lodgings.&nbsp; The orderly
workman marries, and acquires the property of furniture.&nbsp;
The mason from the departments lives cheaply, and saves, to go
home with money to his family, and acquire in his own village the
property of land.&nbsp; The workman bound to Paris, who dwells
only in furnished lodgings, and has bought no furniture, has
rarely saved, and has rarely made an honest marriage.&nbsp; In
most cases he is a lover of pleasure, frequents the theatre and
the wine shop.&nbsp; From wine he runs on to the stronger
stimulus of brandy; but these leave to him some gleams of his
national vivacity.&nbsp; The most degraded does not get so
lumpish as the English workman, whose brains have become sodden
in the public-houses by long trains of pots of beer.&nbsp; By far
the largest portion of the Paris workmen possess furniture: only
twenty-one in a hundred&mdash;and that includes, of course, the
mobile population, the masons, etc.&mdash;live in furnished
lodgings.</p>
<p>For clothing we spend, according to our means, from four to
fourteen pounds a year.&nbsp; Half of us have no coat in addition
to the blouse.&nbsp; Before the crisis of eighteen hundred and
forty-eight, one sixth of us had money in savings&rsquo; banks,
and one man in every two was a member of some benefit
society.&nbsp; The benefit societies were numerous, each
generally containing some two or three hundred members; but even
our singing clubs are now suppressed, and we must not meet even
to transact the business of a benefit society without giving
notice of our design to the police, and receiving into our party
at least two of its agents as lookers-on.&nbsp; The result has
been the decay of all such societies, and the extinction of most
of them.&nbsp; Where they remain, the average monthly
subscription is fifteen-pence, which insures the payment of
twenty-pence a day during sickness, with gratuitous advice and
medicine from the doctor.&nbsp; The funds of such societies are
lodged either in savings&rsquo; banks, or in the <i>Mont de
Piet&eacute;</i>; which, though properly a pawnbroking
establishment, has also its uses as a bank.&nbsp; The <!-- page
147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>imperial fist presses everywhere down upon us.&nbsp; It
has forced us out of sick clubs, because we sometimes talked in
them about the state of the nation: it would build us huge
barracks to live in, so that we may be had continually under
watch and ward; and it has lately thrust in upon us a president
of its own at the head of our <i>Conseil de
Prud&rsquo;hommes</i>, the only tribunal we possess for the
adjustment of our internal trade disputes.</p>
<p>Of our pleasures on a Sunday afternoon the world has
heard.&nbsp; We devote that to our families, if we have any;
Monday, too often, to our friends.&nbsp; There are on Sundays our
feats of gymnastics at open-air balls beyond the barriers, and
our dancing saloons in the city; such as the Prado, the Bal
Montesquieu, and the Dogs&rsquo; Ball.&nbsp; There are our
pleasant country rambles, and our pleasant little dinners in the
fields.&nbsp; There are our games at poule, and dominoes, and
piquet; and our pipes with dexterously blackened bowls.&nbsp;
There are our theatres, the Funambule and the Porte St.
Martin.&nbsp; Gamblers among us play at bowls in the Elysian
fields, or they stay at home losing and winning more than they
can properly afford to risk at <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Then there are our holidays.&nbsp; The best used to be
&ldquo;the three days of July,&rdquo; but they were lost in the
last scramble.&nbsp; Yet we still have no lack of holiday
amusement; our puppets to admire, and greasy poles to climb for
prizes by men who have been prudently required first to declare
and register their ambition at the Bureau of Police.&nbsp;
Government so gets something like a list of the men who aspire;
who wish to mount.&nbsp; It must be very useful.&nbsp; There are
our water tournaments at St. Cloud and at Boulogne-sur-Seine;
where they who have informed the police of their combative
propensities, may thrust at each other with long-padded poles
from boats which are being rowed forcibly into collision.&nbsp;
We are not much of water-birds, but when we do undertake boating,
we engage in the work like Algerine pirates.&nbsp; We must have a
red sash round the waist or not a man of us will pull a
stroke.</p>
<p>To go back to our homes and to our wives.&nbsp; When we do
marry, we prefer a wife who can support herself by her own
labour.&nbsp; If we have children, it is in our power to
apply&mdash;and very many of us do apply&mdash;to the Bureau of
Nurses; and, soon after an infant&rsquo;s birth, it can be sent
down into the country at the monthly cost of about ten shillings
and two pounds of lump sugar.&nbsp; That prevents the child from
hindering our work or pleasure; and, as it is the interest of
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>the nurse to protect the child for which she receives
payment, why should we disturb our consciences with qualm or
fear?</p>
<p>In Paris there are few factories; some that have existed were
removed into the provinces for the sole purpose of avoiding the
dictation of the workmen in the town.&nbsp; The Parisian fancy
work employs a large number of people who can work at their own
homes.&nbsp; In this, and in the whole industry of Paris, the
division of labour is very great; but the fancy work offers a
good deal of scope for originality and taste, and the workman of
Paris is glad to furnish both.&nbsp; He will delight himself by
working night and day to execute a sudden order, to be equal to
some great occasion; but he cannot so well be depended upon when
the work falls again into its even, humdrum pace.&nbsp; On the
whole, however, they who receive good wages, and are
trusted&mdash;as the men working for jewellers are
trusted&mdash;become raised by the responsibility of their
position, shun the wine-shop, live contented with the pleasures
of their homes, dress with neatness, and would die rather than
betray the confidence reposed in them.&nbsp; With all his faults
and oddities, the workman of Paris is essentially a thoroughly
good fellow.&nbsp; The solitary work of tailors and of shoemakers
causes them of course to brood and think, and to turn out of
their body a great number of men who take a foremost place in all
political discussions.&nbsp; But the French workman always is a
loser by political disturbance.&nbsp; The crisis of eighteen
hundred and forty-eight&mdash;a workman&rsquo;s
triumph&mdash;reduced the value of industry in Paris from sixty
to twenty-eight millions of pounds.&nbsp; Fifty-four men in every
hundred were at the same time thrown out of employ, or nearly two
hundred thousand people in all.</p>
<p>But there are some callings, indeed, wholly untouched by a
crisis.&nbsp; The manufacture of street gas goes on, for example,
without any change.&nbsp; There are others that are even
benefited by a revolution.&nbsp; After the last revolution, while
other trades were turning away men to whom there was no longer
work to give, the trades concerned in providing military
equipment were taking on fresh hands.&nbsp; To that class in
Paris, and to that only, there was an increase of business in
eighteen hundred and forty-eight to the extent of twenty-nine per
cent.&nbsp; The decrease of business among the printers, although
few books were printed, did not amount to more than twenty-seven
per cent., in consequence of the increased demand for
proclamations, handbills, and manifestoes.</p>
<p>Without any extra crisis, men working in all trades have
trouble <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>enough to get over the mere natural
checks upon industry, which come to most tradesmen twice a year
in the shape of the dead seasons.&nbsp; Every month is a dead
season to some trade; but the dead seasons which prevail over the
largest number of workmen in Paris are the two months, July and
August, in summer, and the two months, January and February, in
winter.&nbsp; The dead season of summer is the more decided of
the two.&nbsp; The periods of greatest activity, on the other
hand, are the two months, April and May, and next to those the
months, October and November.&nbsp; Printers are busiest in
winter, builders are busiest in summer&mdash;so there are
exceptions to the rule; but, except those who provide certain
requisites for eating and drinking which are in continual demand,
there are few workmen in Paris or elsewhere in France, who have
not every year quite enough slack time to perplex them.&nbsp;
They can ill afford the interference of any small crisis in the
shape of a strike, or large crisis in the shape of a national
tumult.</p>
<p>Finally, let me say that the French workman, take him all in
all, is certainly a clever fellow.&nbsp; He is fond of Saint
Monday, &ldquo;solidarity,&rdquo; and shows; but is quickwitted
at his work, and furiously energetic when there is any strong
call made upon his industry.&nbsp; In the most debased form he
has much more vigour and vivacity than the most debased of
English operatives.&nbsp; He may be more immoral; but he is less
brutish.&nbsp; If we are a little vain, and very fond of gaiety;
and if we are improvident, we are not idle; and, with all our
street fighting, we are not a discontented race.&nbsp; Except an
Arab, who can be so happy as we know how to make ourselves, upon
the smallest possible resources?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">licensed to
juggle</span>.</p>
<p>Some years ago a short iron-built man used to balance a
scaffold pole upon his chin; to whizz a slop-basin round upon the
end of it; and to imitate fire-works with golden balls and
gleaming knives, in the public streets of London.&nbsp; I am
afraid his genius was <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>not rewarded in his own country; for
not long ago I saw him starring it in Paris.&nbsp; As I stood by
to watch his evolutions, in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, I felt a
patriotic glow when they were rewarded with the enthusiastic
applause of a very wide and thick ring of French spectators.</p>
<p>There was one peculiarity in his performance which
distinguished him from French open-air artistes&mdash;he never
spoke.&nbsp; Possibly he was diffident of his French
accent.&nbsp; He simply uttered a grunt when he wished to call
attention to any extraordinary perfection in his performance; in
imitation, perhaps, of the &ldquo;La!&mdash;la!&rdquo; of the
prince of French acrobats, Auriol.&nbsp; Whatever he attempted he
did well; that is to say, in a solid, deliberate, thorough
manner.&nbsp; His style of chin-balancing, knife-catching,
ball-throwing, and ground and lofty tumbling, was not so agile or
flippant as that of his French competitors, but he never
failed.&nbsp; On the circulation of his hat, the French halfpence
were dropped in with great liberality.</p>
<p>As the fall of the curtain denotes the close of a play, so the
raising of the square of carpet signifies the end of a
juggler&rsquo;s performance; and, when my old acquaintance had
rolled up his little bit of tapestry, and had pocketed his sous,
I accosted him&mdash;&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;an
Englishman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; he observed, familiarly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you to a glass of something, and a
chat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say?&rdquo; he repeated, with a very broad grin,
&ldquo;why, yes, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tumbler, with his tools done up in a carpet-bag closed at
the mouth with a bit of rope, and your humble servant were
speedily seated in a neighbouring wine-shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you prefer to drink?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cure-a-sore,&rdquo; he modestly answered.</p>
<p>The epicure!&nbsp; Quality and not quantity was evidently his
taste; a sign of, at least, a sober fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You find yourself tolerably well off in
Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I did,&rdquo; he answered, smacking his
lips, &ldquo;for I wos a wagabon in London; but here I am an
artiste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A distinction only in name, I suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps it is; but there&rsquo;s a good deal of
difference, mind you.&nbsp; In England (I have been a&rsquo;most
all over it) a feller in my line is a wagabon.&nbsp; He
don&rsquo;t take no standing in society.&nbsp; He may be quiet,
never get into no trouble, and never give nobody else none; but
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>that don&rsquo;t help him.&nbsp; &lsquo;He gits his
livin&rsquo; in the streets,&rsquo; they say, and that&rsquo;s
enough.&nbsp; Well, &rsquo;spose he does? he &rsquo;as to work
tremenjus hard for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His certainly cannot be an idle life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just ain&rsquo;t, if they&rsquo;d only let us alone;
but they won&rsquo;t&mdash;them blessed Peelers I mean.&nbsp; How
would you like it?&rdquo; he continued, appealing to me with as
hard a look in the face as if I had been his most implacable
enemy, &ldquo;how would you like it, if you had looked up a jolly
good pitch, and a reg&rsquo;lar good comp&rsquo;ny was a looking
on&mdash;at the west end, in a slap up street, where there
ain&rsquo;t no thoroughfare&mdash;and jist as you&rsquo;re a
doin&rsquo; the basin, and the browns is a droppin&rsquo; into
the &rsquo;at, up comes a Peeler.&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Move on!&rsquo;&nbsp; You must go;&rdquo; he stared harder
than ever, and thumped his hand on the table; &ldquo;I say you
<i>must</i> go, and lose p&rsquo;raps a pick up as
&rsquo;u&rsquo;d keep you for a week.&nbsp; How would you like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should expostulate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spostallate!&mdash;would you?&rdquo; a slight curl of
the lip, expressive of contempt at my ignorance of the general
behaviour of policemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! if you say
&rsquo;bo!&rsquo; to a Peeler he pulls you, and what&rsquo;s the
consequence?&nbsp; Why, a month at the Steel!&rdquo;&mdash;which
hard name I understood to be given to the House of
Correction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the police are not unreasonable,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, p&rsquo;raps some of &rsquo;em
ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t pick
out your policemen, that&rsquo;s where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the police never interfere with you here?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used to it; and I&rsquo;ve had to beg back my
traps more than once from the borough of the Police
Correctionell, as they call it; but then that was &rsquo;cause I
was hignorant of the law.&nbsp; When they see that I could git a
&rsquo;onest living, an old cove in a cocked hat ses he to me,
ses he, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a saltimbanc, you are.&nbsp; Wery
good.&nbsp; You go to the borough of police for public morals,
and the minister (not a parson, mind you, but the &rsquo;ed
hinspector), if he&rsquo;s satisfied with your character
he&rsquo;ll give you a ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course he did; and I&rsquo;m now one of the
reg&rsquo;lar perfession.&nbsp; I aint to be hinterfered with;
leastways, without I&rsquo;m donkey enough to go on the cross and
be took up.&nbsp; <i>That&rsquo;s</i> the ticket,&rdquo; he
exclaimed triumphantly, pulling out a bronze badge,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number thirty-five, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you perform anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;No; the police picked out thirteen good
places&mdash;&lsquo;pitches,&rsquo; we calls
&rsquo;em&mdash;where we can play.&nbsp; Ther&rsquo;s the
list&mdash;thirteen on &rsquo;em all of a row&mdash;beginning on
the Boulevards at the Place de la Colonne de Juilliet, and ending
in the Champs Elys&eacute;es.&rdquo;&nbsp; He unfolded a neatly
written document that plainly defined the limits of Paris within
which he, in common with his co-professors, was allowed to
display his abilities.</p>
<p>With a small gratuity for the new light thrown upon the
subject of street performances, I parted from my enterprising
countryman, wishing him every success.</p>
<p>I have sometimes wondered whether&mdash;considering that we
have all sorts of licensed people about us; people who are
licensed to cram us upon steam-boats; to crowd us into omnibuses;
to jolt us in ramshackle cabs; to supply us with bad brandy and
other adulterated drinks; licentiates for practising physic;
licentiates for carrying parcels; licentiates for taking money at
their own doors for the diversions of singing and dancing;
licentiates for killing game with gunpowder, which other people
have been licensed to make&mdash;whether, I say, it would not be
wise to license in England out-of-door as well as in-door
amusements.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">p&egrave;re
panpan</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Panpan lives in the Place Valois,&rdquo; said
my friend, newly arrived from London on a visit to Paris,
&ldquo;and as I am under a promise to his brother Victor to
deliver a message on his behalf, I must keep my word even if I go
alone, and execute my mission in pantomime.&nbsp; Will you be my
interpreter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Place Valois is a dreamy little square formed by tall
houses: graced by an elegant fountain in its centre; guarded by a
red-legged sentinel; and is chiefly remarkable in Parisian annals
as the scene of the assassination of the Duc de Berri.&nbsp;
There is a quiet, melancholy air about the place which accords
well with its <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>traditions; and even the little
children who make it their playground on account of the absence
of both vehicles and equestrians, pursue their sports in a
subdued, tranquil way, hanging about the fountain&rsquo;s edge,
and dabbling in the water with their little fingers.&nbsp;
Monsieur Panpan&rsquo;s residence was not difficult to
find.&nbsp; We entered by a handsome porte-coch&egrave;re into a
paved court-yard, and, having duly accounted for our presence to
the watchful concierge who sat sedulously peering out of a green
sentry-box, commenced our ascent to the upper regions.&nbsp;
Seeing that Monsieur lived on the fourth floor, and that the
steps of the spacious staircase were of that shallow description
which disappoint the tread by falling short of its expectations,
it was no wonder that we were rather out of breath when we
reached the necessary elevation; and that we paused a moment to
collect our thoughts, and calm our respiration, before knocking
at the little backroom door, which we knew to be that of Monsieur
Panpan.</p>
<p>Madame Panpan received us most graciously, setting chairs for
us, and apologising for her husband, who, poor man, was sitting
up in his bed, with a wan countenance, and hollow glistening
eyes.&nbsp; We were in the close heavy air of a sick
chamber.&nbsp; The room was very small, and the bedstead occupied
a large portion of its space.&nbsp; It was lighted by one little
window only, and that looked down a sort of square shaft which
served as a ventilator to the house.&nbsp; A pale child, with
large wandering eyes, watched us intently from behind the end of
the little French bedstead, while the few toys he had been
playing with lay scattered upon the floor.&nbsp; The room was
very neat, although its furniture was poor and scanty; and by the
brown saucepan perched upon the top of the diminutive German
stove, which had strayed, as it were, from its chimney corner
into the middle of the room, we knew that the pot-au-feu was in
preparation.&nbsp; Madame, before whom was a small table covered
with the unfinished portions of a corset, was very
agreeable&mdash;rather coquettish, indeed, we should have said in
England.&nbsp; Her eyes were bright and cheerful, and her hair
drawn back from her forehead &agrave; la Chinoise.&nbsp; In a
graceful, but decided way, she apologised for continuing her
labours, which were evidently works of necessity rather than of
choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Victor, that good boy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, when
we had further explained the object of our visit, &ldquo;was
quite well!&nbsp; I am charmed!&nbsp; And he had found work, and
succeeding so well in his <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>affairs?&nbsp; I am enchanted!&nbsp; It is so amiable
of him to send me this little cadeau!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Panpan, with his strange lustrous eyes, if not
enchanted, rubbed his thin bony hands together as he sat up in
the bed, and chuckled in an unearthly way at the good news.&nbsp;
Having executed our commission, we felt it would be intrusive to
prolong our stay, and therefore rose to depart, but received so
pressing an invitation to repeat the visit, that, on the part of
myself and friend, who was to leave Paris in a few days, I could
not refuse to comply with a wish so cordially expressed, and
evidently sincere.&nbsp; And thus commenced my acquaintance with
the Panpans.</p>
<p>I cannot trace the course of our acquaintance, or tell how,
from an occasional call, my visits became those of a bosom
friend; but certain it is, that soon each returning Sunday saw me
a guest at the table of Monsieur Panpan, where my couvert and
serviette became sacred to my use; and, after the meal, were
carefully cleaned and laid apart for the next occasion.&nbsp;
This, I afterwards learned, was a customary mark of consideration
towards an esteemed friend among the poorer class of
Parisians.&nbsp; I soon learned their history.&nbsp; Their
every-day existence was a simple, easily read story, and not the
less simple and touching because it is the every-day story of
thousands of poor French families.&nbsp; Madame was a stay-maker;
and the whole care and responsibility of providing for the wants
and comforts of a sick husband; for her little Victor, her eldest
born; and the monthly stipend of her infant Henri, out at nurse
some hundred leagues from Paris, hung upon the unaided exertions
of her single hands, and the scrupulous and wonderful economy of
her management.</p>
<p>One day I found Madame in tears.&nbsp; Panpan himself lay with
rigid features, and his wiry hands spread out upon the
counterpane.&nbsp; Madame was at first inconsolable and
inexplicable, but at length, amid sobs, half suppressed, related
the nature of their new misfortune.&nbsp; Would Monsieur believe
that those miserable nurse-people, insulting as they were, had
sent from the country to say, that unless the three months
nursing of little Henri, together with the six pounds of lump
sugar, which formed part of the original bargain, were
immediately paid, cette pauvre b&ecirc;te (Henri that was), would
be instantly dispatched to Paris, and proceedings taken for the
recovery of the debt?&nbsp; Ces miserables!</p>
<p>Here poor Madame Panpan could not contain herself, but gave
<!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>way to her affliction in a violent outburst of
tears.&nbsp; And yet the poor child, the cause of all this
sorrow, was almost as great stranger to his mother as he was to
me, who had never seen him in my life.&nbsp; With scarcely a
week&rsquo;s existence to boast of, he had been swaddled up in
strange clothes; intrusted to strange hands; and hurried away
some hundred leagues from the capital, to scramble about the clay
floor of an unwholesome cottage, in company perhaps with some
half-dozen atomies like himself, as strange to each other as they
were to their own parents, to pass those famous mois de nourrice
which form so important and momentous a period in the lives of
most French people.&nbsp; Madame Panpan was however in no way
responsible for this state of things; the system was there, not
only recognised, but encouraged; become indeed a part of the
social habits of the people, and it was no wonder if her poverty
should have driven her to so popular and ready a means of meeting
a great difficulty.&nbsp; How she extricated herself from this
dilemma, it is not necessary to state; suffice it to say, that a
few weeks saw cette petite b&ecirc;te Henri, happily domiciled in
the Place Valois; and, if not overburdened with apparel, at least
released from the terrible debt of six and thirty francs, and six
pounds of lump-sugar.</p>
<p>It naturally happened, that on the pleasant Sunday afternoons,
when we had disposed of our small, but often sumptuous dinner;
perhaps a gigot de mouton with a clove of garlic in the knuckle;
a fricass&eacute;e de lapins with onions, or a fricandeau, Panpan
himself would tell me part of his history; and in the course of
our salad; of our little dessert of fresh fruit, or currant
jelly; or perhaps, stimulated by the tiniest glass of brandy,
would grow warm in the recital of his early experiences, and the
unhappy chance which had brought him into his present
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur!&rdquo; he said one day, &ldquo;little
would you think, to see me cribbed up in this miserable bed, that
I had been a soldier, or that the happiest days of my life had
been passed in the woods of Fontainebleau, following the chase in
the retinue of King Charles the Tenth of France.&nbsp; I was a
wild young fellow in my boyhood; and, when at the age of eighteen
I drew for the conscription and found it was my fate to serve, I
believe I never was so happy in my life.&nbsp; I entered the
cavalry; and, in spite of the heavy duties and strict discipline,
it was a glorious time.&nbsp; It makes me mad, Monsieur, when I
think of the happy days I have spent on the road, in barracks,
and in snug country quarters, where there was cider or <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>wine for the asking; to find myself in a solitary
corner of great, thoughtless Paris, sick and helpless.&nbsp; It
would be something to die out in the open fields like a worn-out
horse, or to be shot like a wounded one.&nbsp; But this is
terrible!&mdash;and I am but thirty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We comforted him in the best way we could with sage axioms of
antique date, or more lively stories of passing events; but I saw
a solitary tear creeping down the cheek of Madame Panpan, even in
the midst of a quaint sally; and, under pretence of arranging his
pillow, she bent over his head and kissed him gently on the
forehead.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Panpan&mdash;I had come by degrees to call him
&ldquo;P&egrave;re,&rdquo; although he was still young; for it
sounded natural and kindly&mdash;continued his narrative in his
rambling, gossiping way.&nbsp; He had been chosen, he said, to
serve in the Garde Royale, of whom fifteen thousand sabres were
stationed in and about the capital at this period; and in the
royal forest of Fontainebleau, in the enjoyment of a sort of
indolent activity, he passed his happiest days; now employed in
the chase, now in the palace immediately about the person of the
king, in a succession of active pleasures, or easy, varied
duties.&nbsp; Panpan was no republican.&nbsp; Indeed, I question
whether any very deep political principles governed his
sentiments; which naturally allied themselves with those things
that yielded the greatest amount of pleasure.</p>
<p>The misfortunes of P&egrave;re Panpan dated from the
revolution of eighteen hundred and thirty.&nbsp; Then the
glittering pageantry in the palace of Fontainebleau vanished like
a dream.&nbsp; The wild clatter of military preparation; the
rattling of steel and the trampling of horses; and away swept
troop after troop, with sword-belt braced and carabine in hand,
to plunge into the mad uproar of the streets of Paris, risen,
stones and all, in revolution.&nbsp; The Garde Royale did their
duty in those three terrible days, and if their gallant charges
through the encumbered streets, or their patient endurance amid
the merciless showers of indescribable missiles, were all in
vain, it was because their foe was animated by an enthusiasm of
which they knew nothing, save in the endurance of its
effects.&nbsp; Panpan&rsquo;s individual fate, amid all this
turmoil, was lamentable enough.</p>
<p>A few hours amid the dust; the sweltering heat; the yellings
of the excited populace; the roaring of cannon and the pattering
of musketry; saw the troop in which he served, broken and
scattered, and Panpan himself rolling in the dust, with a
thousand lights flashing in his eyes, and a brass button lodged
in his side!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those villains of Parisians!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;not content with <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>showering
their whole garde meuble upon our heads, fired upon us a
diabolical collection of missiles, such as no mortal ever thought
of before:&mdash;bits of broken brass; little plates of tin and
iron rolled into sugar-loaves; crushed brace-buckles; crooked
nails and wads of metal wire;&mdash;anything, indeed, that in
their extremity they could lay their hands on, and ram into the
muzzle of a gun!&nbsp; These things inflicted fearful gashes,
and, in many cases, a mere flesh-wound turned out a
death-stroke.&nbsp; Few that got hurt in our own troop lived to
tell the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more days and the whole royal cavalcade was scattered
like chaff before the wind, and Charles the Tenth a fugitive on
his way to England; a few more days and the wily Louis Philippe
was taking the oath to a new constitution, and our friend,
Panpan, lay carefully packed, brass button and all, in the
H&ocirc;tel-Dieu.&nbsp; The brass button was difficult to find,
and when found the ugly fissure it had made grew gangrened, and
would not heal; and thus it happened that many a bed became
vacant, and got filled, and was vacant again, as their occupants
either walked out, or were borne out, of the hospital gates,
before Panpan was declared convalescent, and finally dismissed
from the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu as &ldquo;cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proud trooper was, however, an altered man; his health and
spirits were gone; the whole corps of which he had so often
boasted was broken up and dispersed; his means of livelihood were
at an end, and, what was worse, he knew of no other in the
exercise of which he could gain his daily bread.&nbsp; There were
very many such helpless, tradeless men pacing the streets of
Paris, when the fever of the revolution was cooled down, and
ordinary business ways began to take their course.&nbsp; Nor was
it those alone who were uninstructed in any useful occupation,
but there were also the turbulent, dissatisfied spirits; builders
of barricades, and leaders of club-sections, whom the late
excitement, and their temporary elevation above their fellow
workmen, had left restless and ambitious, and whose awakened
energies, if not directed to some useful and congenial
employment, would infallibly lead to mischief.</p>
<p>Panpan chuckled over the fate which awaited some of these
ardent youths: &ldquo;Ces gaillards l&agrave;!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;had become too proud and troublesome to be left long in
the streets of Paris; they would have fomented another
revolution; so Louis Philippe, under pretence of rewarding his
brave &lsquo;soldats laboureurs,&rsquo; whom he was ready to
shake by the hand in the public streets in the first flush of
success, <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>enrolled them in the army, and sent
them to the commanding officers with medals of honour round their
necks, and special recommendations to promotion in their
hands.&nbsp; They hoped to become Marshals of France in no
time.&nbsp; Pauvres diables! they were soon glad to hide their
decorations, and cease bragging about street-fighting and
barricades, for the regulars relished neither their swaggering
stories nor the notion of being set aside by such parvenus; and
they got so quizzed, snubbed, and tormented, that they were happy
at last to slide into their places as simple soldats, and trust
to the ordinary course for promotion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As for Panpan, his street wanderings terminated in his finding
employment in a lace manufactory, and it soon became evident that
his natural talent here found a congenial occupation.&nbsp; He
came by degrees to be happy in his new position of a
workman.&nbsp; Then occurred the serious love passage of his
life&mdash;his meeting with Louise, now Madame Panpan.&nbsp; It
was the simplest matter in the world: Panpan, to whom life was
nothing without the Sunday quadrille at the barri&egrave;re,
having resolved to figure on the next occasion in a pair of
bottes vernis, waited upon his bootmaker&mdash;every Parisian has
his bootmaker&mdash;to issue his mandates concerning their
length, shape, and general construction.&nbsp; He entered the
boutique of Mons. Cuire, when, lo! he beheld in the little back
parlour, the most delicate little foot that ever graced a shoe,
or tripped to measure on the grass.&nbsp; He would say nothing of
the owner of this miracle; of her face&mdash;which was full of
intelligence; of her figure&mdash;which was gentille toute
&agrave; fait&mdash;but for that dear, chaste, ravishing model of
a foot! so modestly pos&eacute; upon the cushion.&nbsp;
Heaven!&mdash;and Panpan unconsciously heaved a long sigh, and
brought with it from the very bottom of his heart a vow to become
its possessor.&nbsp; There was no necessity for anything very
rash or very desperate in the case, as it happened, for the
evident admiration of Panpan had inspired Louise with an
impromptu interest in his favour, and he being besides gentil
gar&ccedil;on, their chance rencontre was but the commencement of
a friendship which ripened into love,&mdash;and so the old story
over again, with marriage at the end of it.</p>
<p>Well! said M. Panpan, time rolled on, and little Louis was
born.&nbsp; This might have been a blessing, but while family
cares and expenses were growing upon them, Panpan&rsquo;s
strength and energies were withering away.&nbsp; He suffered
little pain, but what there was seemed <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>to spring
from the old wound; and there were whole days when he lay a mere
wreck, without the power or will to move; and when his feeble
breath seemed passing away for ever.&nbsp; Happily, these
relapses occurred only at intervals, but by slow degrees they
became more frequent and more overwhelming.&nbsp; Madame
Panpan&rsquo;s skill and untiring perseverance grew to be, as
other resources failed, the main, and for many, many months, the
whole support of the family.&nbsp; Then came a time when the
winter had passed away, and the spring was already in its full,
and still Panpan lay helpless in bed with shrunken limbs and
hollow, pallid cheeks,&mdash;and then little Henri was born.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Panpan having arrived at this crisis in his
history, drew a long breath, and stretched himself back in his
bed.&nbsp; I knew the rest.&nbsp; It was soon after the event
last named that I made his acquaintance, and the remainder of his
simple story, therefore, devolves upon me.</p>
<p>The debility of the once dashing soldier increased daily, and
as it could be traced to no definite cause, he gradually became a
physiological enigma; and thence naturally a pet of the medical
profession.&nbsp; Not that he was a profitable patient, for the
necessities of the family were too great to allow of so expensive
a luxury as a doctor&rsquo;s bill; but urged, partly by
commiseration, and partly by professional curiosity, both ardent
students and methodical practitioners would crowd round his
simple bed, probing him with instruments, poking him with their
fingers, and punching him with their fists; each with a new
theory to propound and establish; and the more they were baffled
and contradicted in their preconceived notions, the more
obstinate they became in their enforcement.&nbsp; Panpan&rsquo;s
own thoughts upon the subject always reverted to the brass
button, although he found few to listen to or encourage him in
his idea.&nbsp; His medical patrons were a constant source of
suffering to him, but he bore with them patiently; sometimes
reviving from his prostration as if inspired, then lapsing as
suddenly into his old state of semi-pain and total
feebleness.&nbsp; As a last hope, he was removed from his fourth
floor in the Place Valois, to become an inmate of the
Bic&ecirc;tre, and a domiciled subject of contention and
experiment to its medical staff.</p>
<p>The Bic&ecirc;tre is a large, melancholy-looking building,
half hospital half madhouse, situated a few leagues from
Paris.&nbsp; I took a distaste to it on my very first
visit.&nbsp; It always struck me as a sort of <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>menagerie,
I suppose from the circumstance of there having been pointed out
to me, immediately on my entrance, a railed and fenced portion of
the building, where the fiercer sort of inhabitants were
imprisoned.&nbsp; Moreover, I met with such strange looks and
grimaces; such bewildering side-glances or moping stares, as I
traversed the open court-yards, with their open corridors, or the
long arched passages of the interior, that the whole of the
inmates came before me as creatures in human shape indeed, but as
possessed by the cunning or the ferocity of the mere
animal.&nbsp; Yet it was a public hospital, and in the
performance of its duties there was an infinite deal of kindly
attention, consummate skill, and unwearying labour.&nbsp; Its
associations were certainly unhappy, and had, I am sure, a
depressing effect upon at least the physically disordered
patients.&nbsp; It may be that as the Bic&ecirc;tre is a sort of
forlorn hope of hospitals, where the more desperate or
inexplicable cases only are admitted, it naturally acquires a
sombre and ominous character; but in no establishment of a
similar kind (and I have seen many) did I meet with such
depressing influences.</p>
<p>Panpan was at first in high spirits at the change.&nbsp; He
was to be restored to health in a brief period, and he really did
in the first few weeks make rapid progress towards
convalescence.&nbsp; Already a sort of gymnasium had been
arranged over his bed, so that he might, by simple muscular
exercises, regain his lost strength; and more than once I have
guided his tottering steps along the arched corridors, as, clad
in the gray uniform of the hospital, and supported by a stick, he
took a brief mid-day promenade.</p>
<p>We made him cheering Sunday visits, Madame Panpan, Louis, the
little Henri, and I, and infringed many a rule of the hospital in
regard to his regimen.&nbsp; There was a charcutier living close
to the outer walks, and when nothing else could be had, we
purchased some of his curiously prepared delicacies, and smuggled
them in under various guises.&nbsp; To him they were delicious
morsels amid the uniform soup and bouillon of the hospital, and I
dare say did him neither good nor harm.</p>
<p>Poor Madame Panpan! apart from the unceasing exertions which
her difficult position demanded of her; apart from the harassing
days, the sleepless nights, and pecuniary deficiencies which
somehow never were made up; apart from the shadow of death which
hovered ever near her; and the unvarying labours which pulled at
her fingers, and strained at her eyes, so that her efforts seemed
still <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>devoted to one ever unfinished
corset,&mdash;there arose another trouble where it was least
expected; and alas! I was the unconscious cause of a new
embarrassment.&nbsp; I was accused of being her lover.&nbsp;
Numberless accusations rose up against us.&nbsp; Had I not played
at pat-ball with Madame in the Bois de Boulogne?&nbsp; Yes,
pardi! while Panpan lay stretched upon the grass a laughing
spectator of the game; and which was brought to an untimely
conclusion by my breaking my head against the branch of a
tree.&nbsp; But had I not accompanied Madame alone to the Champs
Elys&eacute;es to witness the jeu-de-feu on the last f&ecirc;te
of July?&nbsp; My good woman, did I not carry Louis pick-a-back
the whole way? and was not the crowd so dense and fearful, that
our progress to the Champs Elys&eacute;es was barred at its very
mouth by the fierce tornado of the multitude, and the trampling
to death of three unhappy mortals, whose shrieks and groans still
echo in my ear? and was it not at the risk of life or limb that I
fought my way along the Rue de la Madeleine, with little Louis
clinging round my neck, and Madame hanging on to my
coat-tail?&nbsp; Amid the swaying and eddying of the crowd, the
mounted Garde Municipale came dashing into the thickest of the
press, to snatch little children, and even women, from impending
death, and bear them to a place of safety.&nbsp; And if we did
take a bottle of Strassburger beer on the Boulevards, when at
length we found a freer place to breathe in, faint and reeling as
we were, pray where was the harm, and who would not have done as
much?&nbsp; Ah, Madame! if you had seen, as I did, that when we
reached home the first thing poor Madame Panpan came to do, was
to fall upon her husband&rsquo;s neck, and in a voice broken with
sobs, and as though her heart would break, to thank that merciful
God who had spared her in her trouble, that she might still work
for him and his children! you would not be so ready with your
blame.</p>
<p>But there was a heavier accusation still.&nbsp; Did you not,
sir, entertain Madame to supper in the Rue de Roule? with the
utmost extravagance too, not to mention the omelette
souffl&eacute;e with which you must needs tickle your appetites,
and expressly order for the occasion?&nbsp; And more than that:
did you not then take coffee in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, and
play at dominoes with Madame in the salon?&nbsp; Alas, yes! all
this is true, and the cause still more true and more sad; for it
was under the terrible impression that Madame Panpan and her two
children&mdash;for they were both with us, you will remember,
even little Henri&mdash;had not eaten of one tolerable meal
throughout <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>a whole week, that these
unpardonable acts were committed on the Sunday.&nbsp; An omelette
souffl&eacute;e, you know, must he ordered; but as for the
dominoes, I admit that that was an indiscretion.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Panpan drooped and drooped.&nbsp; The cord of his
gymnasium swung uselessly above his head; he tottered no more
along the corridors of the hospital.&nbsp; He had ceased to be
the pet of the medical profession.&nbsp; His malady was obstinate
and impertinent; it could neither be explained nor driven away;
and as all the deep theories propounded respecting it, or carried
into practical operation for its removal, proved to be mere
elaborate fancies, or useless experiments, the medical
profession&mdash;happily for Panpan&mdash;retired from the field
in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe it was the button!&rdquo; exclaimed
Panpan, one Sunday afternoon, with a strange light gleaming in
his eyes.&nbsp; Madame replied only with a sob.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have seen many of them?&rdquo; he abruptly demanded of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a great many of them made in England,&rdquo;
I replied.&nbsp; Where were we wandering?</p>
<p>Panpan took my hand in his, and, with a gentle pressure that
went to my very heart, exclaimed: &ldquo;I do believe it was the
brass button after all.&nbsp; I hope to God it was not an English
button!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say whether it was or not.&nbsp; But, as to poor
P&egrave;re Panpan, we buried him at Bic&ecirc;tre.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">some german
sundays</span>.</p>
<p>Of how Sunday is really spent by the labouring classes in some
towns in Germany, I claim, as an English workman who has worked
and played on German ground, some right to speak.&nbsp; It is
possible that I may relate matters which some do not suspect, and
concerning which others have already made up their minds; but, as
I shall <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>tell nothing but truths, I trust I
may not very much disconcert the former, nor put the latter
completely out of patience; nor offend anybody.</p>
<p>To begin with Hamburg.&nbsp; I spent seven months in this
free, commercial port.&nbsp; I came into Hamburg on a Sunday
morning; and, although everything was new and strange to me, and
a number of things passed before my eyes which could never be
seen in decorous London, yet there were unmistakable signs of
Sunday in them all&mdash;only it was not the Sunday to which I
had been born and bred.&nbsp; The shops were closed, and there
was stillness in the houses, if not in the streets.&nbsp; I
passed by the fore-courted entrance to a theatre, and its doors
were shut; but one could easily guess by the bills at the
door-posts that it offered histrionic entertainment for the
evening.&nbsp; Wandering through some beautifully-wooded walks
which encircle the city, I met many promenaders, trim,
well-dressed, and chatty; and when I turned back into the city,
was once or twice absorbed in the streams of people which flowed
from the church doors.&nbsp; One thing was certain; the people
were not at work.&nbsp; It struck me at once; for I met them at
every turn in their clean faces and spruce clothes&mdash;the
veritable mechanic may be known in every country&mdash;and there
was the happy look and the lounging gait in all, which told that
they had laid down their implements of trade for that day, and
were thoroughly at leisure.&nbsp; When I came to be domiciled and
fairly at work, I learned to discriminate more clearly between
many apparently irreconcilable things; and will here roughly set
down what we did, or did not, on Sundays, in the emporium and
outlet of Northern Germany; which, it will be well to remember,
is thoroughly Lutheran-Protestant in its faith.</p>
<p>There was a church not far from our workshop&mdash;I think the
Jacobi-Kirche&mdash;which had the sweetest set of Dutch bells
that ever rung to measure, and these played at six o&rsquo;clock
in the morning on every day in the week; but, to our minds, they
never played so beautiful a melody as when they woke us on the
Sunday morning, to the delightful consciousness of being able to
listen to them awhile, through the drowsy medium of our upper
feather bed.&nbsp; Once fairly roused, properly attired, and
breakfasted with the Herr, what did we next?&nbsp; Sometimes we
worked till mid-day, but that was a rarity; for our ordinary
day&rsquo;s labour was thirteen hours, <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>with
scarcely a blink of rest at meal-times, and often we had not
stirred from the house during the whole week, but had worn out
the monotonous hours between bed and workboard.&nbsp; When,
however, orders pressed, we did work; but this again was no new
thing to me, for I had done the same thing in London; had toiled
deep into the Saturday night, and had been up again to work on
the Sunday morning, because some gentleman or lady who was
engaged, I dare say, in their morning devotions, could not bide
the ordinary time for their trinkets.&nbsp; If we did work, which
as I have said was a rarity, our ordinary pay of two schillinge,
scarcely twopence per hour, was increased to three.</p>
<p>Sometimes we went to church; and we always found a goodly
congregation there.&nbsp; The service was in good honest German;
and the preacher&mdash;quaintly conspicuous to an English eye by
his velvet skull-cap, and a wonderfully plaited frill which
bristled round his neck&mdash;was always earnest and impressive,
and often eloquent.&nbsp; Among other religious services, I well
remember that of the Busse and Bet-Tag (day of Repentance and
Prayer); the anniversary of the battle of Leipsic; and a
remarkable sermon preached on St. Michael&rsquo;s Day, and of
which I bought a copy after the service of a poor widow who stood
at the church door.&nbsp; If the weather were fine, we strolled
along the banks of the beautiful Alster, or made short excursions
into the country; and here again all was repose, for I recollect
having once had pointed out to me as a matter of wonder a woman
who was toiling in the field.&nbsp; Or, if the weather were
stormy and wet, we stayed in the workshop and read, or made
drawings, or worked in the manufacture of some favourite
tool.&nbsp; Often, again, we had especial duties to perform on
that day in the shape of visiting some sick craftsman in the
hospital, to pay him his weekly allowance, or convey him a book,
or some little creature comforts.&nbsp; The Sunday morning was an
authorised visiting time, and the hospital was usually
crowded&mdash;too crowded with patients, as we thought&mdash;and
each had his cluster of cheering friends.&nbsp; Or we paid
friendly visits to fellow workmen; smoked quiet pipes, and told
travellers&rsquo; stories; or listened to the uncertain essays of
our brethren of the M&auml;nnergesangverein as they practised
their part music.&nbsp; There was one piece of business
transacted on the Sunday morning which may have been sinful,
although we did not view it in that light.&nbsp; We paid our
tailors&rsquo; bills on the Sunday morning if we had <!-- page
165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>the money, or ordered new garments if we had credit;
and I believe it is a practice more generally prevalent even in
England than gentlefolks are apt to imagine.</p>
<p>We dined with the Herr at noon, and at one o&rsquo;clock were
at liberty for the day.&nbsp; I have seen a Danish harvest-home
on a Sunday afternoon in the pretty village of Altona; watching
its merry mummers as they passed by the old church-yard wall,
where Klopstock lies buried.&nbsp; I have attended a funeral as a
real mourner, followed by the mourning professionals in the
theatrical trappings with which the custom of Hamburg usually
adorns them.&nbsp; If we bent our steps, as we sometimes did,
through the Altona gate to Hamburger Berg, we came upon a scene
of hubbub and animation which was something between Clare Market
on Saturday night, and High Street, Greenwich, at fair
time.&nbsp; Stalls, booths, and baskets lined the way; flowers,
fruit, and pastry disputed possession of the side-paths with
sugar-plums, sticks and tobacco-pipes; and, although
Franconi&rsquo;s Circus was not open yet, it gave every promise
of being so; and the air already rang with voices of showmen, and
the clangour of instruments.&nbsp; In the Summer there were gay
boats on the Alster, and nautical holiday-makers were busy with
oar and sail; while, in the Winter months, if the ice held well,
there was no end of skating and sledging; and then we had a
pleasant winter-garden near the Tivoli, with orange-trees in
tubs, the mould so covered over as to form extemporary tables,
and the green leaves and pale fruit shining above our
heads.&nbsp; At the upper end was a conservatory of choice
plants, which was more particularly appropriated to the ladies
and children.&nbsp; The caf&eacute; pavilions on the Alster
steamed odoriferously; punch and hot coffee were in the
ascendant; and there were more cigars smoked in an afternoon on
the Jungfern Stieg (the Maiden&rsquo;s Walk) than would have
stored the cases of a London suburban tobacconist.</p>
<p>These may, perhaps, be reckoned mere idlings, but there were
occasionally official doings on the Sunday, which might have been
national, if Hamburg had been a nation, and which no doubt were
eminently popular.&nbsp; Two such, I remember; one a grand review
of the B&uuml;rger Milit&auml;r; the other the public
confirmation of the apprentices and others, and the conscription
of the youth of the city.&nbsp; The former was a trying
affair.&nbsp; Some twelve thousand citizen-soldiers had to turn
out, fully rigged and equipped, by early dawn, ready for any
amount of drill and evolution.&nbsp; Many were the
stories&mdash;more witty than generous&mdash;of the whereabout of
their uniforms <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>and accoutrements; as to their being
deposited in Lombardian hands, or wholly used up since the last
grand field-day some three years before.&nbsp; Such furbishing as
there was of brass ornaments and metal-buttons; such an oiling
and sand-papering of brown muskets, and such a rearrangement of
blue tunics which, after all, did not match in colour, length,
nor appointments!&nbsp; Fortunately our warriors did not burn
powder; and there was enough of military ardour among them to
carry them through the fatigue of the day.&nbsp; It required a
great deal; for, like other military bodies of a late day, the
commissariat department totally broke down, and citizens were
kept hungering and thirsting upon the blank, dusty plain, within
half-a-mile of stored-up abundance.&nbsp; The confirmation of the
apprentices and the conscription of the young men was a more
serious matter.&nbsp; It took place in the great square, where a
stage and pavilion were erected; all the authority of the senate,
and the services of the church were united to render it solemn
and impressive.&nbsp; It was a source of deep interest to many of
my own acquaintances, more especially to the young cooper who
worked underground at our house, and who, just released from his
apprenticeship, had the good or ill fortune to be drawn for the
next year&rsquo;s levy.</p>
<p>There was one institution, not precisely of Hamburg, but at
the very doors of it, which exercised considerable influence upon
its habits and morals, and that of no beneficial kind.&nbsp; This
was the Danish State Lottery, the office of which was at Altona,
where the prizes were periodically drawn upon Sunday.&nbsp; The
Hamburgers were supposed to receive certain pecuniary advantages
from this lottery in the shape of benefits bestowed upon the
Waisenkinder of the town, who, like our own blue-coat boys of the
old time, were the drawers of the numbers; but the advantages
were very questionable, seeing that the bulk of speculators were
the Hamburgers themselves, and the great prizes of the
undertaking went to swell the Danish Royal Treasury.&nbsp;
Portions of shares could be purchased for as low a sum as
fourpence, and the Hamburg Senate, in self-defence, and with a
great show of propriety, prohibited the traffic of them among
servants and apprentices: which prohibition passed, of course,
for next to nothing, seeing that the temptation was very strong,
and the injunction very weak.&nbsp; It was a curious sight to
witness the crowd upon the occasion of a public drawing in the
quaint old square of Altona; a pebble-dotted space with a dark
box in the centre, not unlike the basement of a gallows.&nbsp; On
this stood the <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>wheel, bright in colours and gold,
and by its side two orphan boys in school-costume, who officiated
at the ceremony.&nbsp; One boy turned the wheel, the other drew
the numbers, and called them aloud as he held them before the
spectators; while the blast of a trumpet heralded the
announcement.&nbsp; What feverish anxiety, what restless cupidity
might be fostering among that crowd no man could calculate, and
certainly, to my mind, there was no worse thing done on the
Sunday in all Hamburg than this exhibition of legalised
gambling.</p>
<p>Of course the theatres were open, and we of the working people
were not unfrequent visitors there.&nbsp; But let us thoroughly
understand the nature of a German theatrical entertainment.&nbsp;
There is rarely more than one piece, and the whole performance is
usually included in the period of two hours&mdash;from seven till
nine.&nbsp; The parterre, or pit, is a mere promenade or standing
place, in which the few seats are let at a higher price than the
rest of the space.&nbsp; The whole of the arrangements are
conducted with the utmost decorum: so much so, that they would
probably disappoint some people who look upon the shouting,
drovers&rsquo; whistling, and &ldquo;hooroar&rdquo; and hissing
of some of our theatres as part of the legitimate drama.&nbsp; On
the Christmas day, when I had the option of getting gloriously
fuddled with a select party of English friends, or of
entertaining myself in some less orthodox way, I preferred to
witness the opera of &ldquo;Norma&rdquo; at the Stadt Theatre,
and think I was the better for the choice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; was the source of another Sunday
evening&rsquo;s gratification (an anniversary play of the
Hamburgers, and intensely popular with the Danes), although with
unpardonable barbarity the German censors entirely blotted out
the gravediggers, and never buried the hapless, &ldquo;sweet
Ophelia.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the gallery of the Imperial Opera House
at Vienna, liveried servants hand sweetmeats, ices, and coffee
about between the acts; and although the Hamburger theatricals
have not yet reached this stage of refinement, there is much in
the shape of social convenience in their arrangement, which even
we might copy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we workmen spent a pleasant hour or two in the
concert-rooms, of which there were several admirably conducted;
or pored hours long over the papers, chiefly literary, in the
Alster Halle; sipping our coffee, and listening in the pauses of
our reading to the band of choice musicians, who played
occasionally through the evening.&nbsp; Sometimes we dived into
snug cellars, where they sold good beer, or mixed odoriferous
punch; and here again music <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>would come,
though in a more questionable shape, her attendant priestesses
being the wandering harp-players, who sang sentimental ditties to
the twanging of their instruments.&nbsp; Other places there were,
some in the city, and some outside the walls, where an abominable
medley of waltz, smoke, wine, and lotto made up the
evening&rsquo;s entertainment.&nbsp; The larger of these
establishments had some pretensions to gentility, seeing that
they did not allow gentlemen to dance with their hats on; but
whatever other claims they set up to the respect of the community
may be briefly set down as worth very little.&nbsp; It will not
unnaturally follow that where there is much liberty there will be
some licence, and with respect to Hamburg, it is in her
dance-houses that this excess is to be found.&nbsp; But where is
the wonder?&nbsp; The Hamburger authorities in this, and some
other cases, set up a sort of excise officer, and grant permits
for this frivolity, and that vice, at a regular scale of
charges.</p>
<p>In spite of these half-incentives and whole encouragements to
laxity of behaviour, what is the general character of the
Hamburger population?&nbsp; I venture to call them provident,
temperate, and industrious.&nbsp; Let it be remembered that we
speak of a mercantile port, in some parts a little like Wapping,
and into and out of which there is a perpetual ebb and flow of
seamen of all nations, full of boisterous humour, of strong life,
and wilful in their recent escape from ship restraint.&nbsp; The
worst of the dance-houses are situated near the water&rsquo;s
edge, and are almost wholly frequented by sailors; while the
other resorts which are open to the charge of licentiousness,
have also a strong proportion of maritime frequenters, and the
rest is mostly made up of the wandering workmen of Germany, to
many of whom Hamburg is a culminating point, and who are, as it
were, out on leave.&nbsp; But, after all, these cancer spots are
few indeed, when compared with the great proportion of the means
of amusement thrown open, or, rather never closed to the
people.&nbsp; Wander on the Sunday when and where you will; in
theatre, concert-room, or coffee-house; in public garden or
beer-cellar; you will find them joyous indeed, sometimes loud in
song or conversation, and taking generally a sort of pride in a
dash of rudeness, calling it independence, but you will never
find them sottish; nowhere cumbering the footway with their
prostrate carcases; nowhere reeling zigzag, blear-eyed and
stupid, to a miserable home.</p>
<p>On tramp towards the South, we rested on the Sunday in
Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg; but there was public <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>mourning in the city for a death in the ducal family,
and the usual Sunday festivities were forbidden.&nbsp; On
attending church in the evening I found a large congregation, and
the service similar to that of Hamburg.&nbsp; In the afternoon,
as there was no military parade or music, over the absence of
which the chambermaids of Der Gross-Herzog moaned dolorously, we
rambled through the ducal garden, admiring the quaintly-shaped
basin in its centre, its numerous statues, and fresh grass.&nbsp;
The town was dull and methodical enough, but would have been
rejoicing, if it had not been respectfully mournful.</p>
<p>Our next resting-place was Berlin, where we stayed two months;
and here, according to our experience, the Sunday afternoon
recreations differed only in tone from those of Hamburg, being
less boisterous in their gaiety than in the former seaman&rsquo;s
paradise.&nbsp; We never worked on Sunday in Berlin, nor did any
of our artizan friends, although there were very pressing orders
in the shape of those unvarying German court douceurs,
diamond-circled snuff boxes, and insignia of the Red and Black
Eagle.&nbsp; Once, we accompanied our principal, by special
invitation, to the Hasenheide, to witness the rifle practice,
civil and military, among its heather and sandy hollows.&nbsp;
Officers and rank and file alike were there; the officer
practising with the private&rsquo;s heavy gewehr, and the private
in his turn with the light weapon of his superior in grade.&nbsp;
There were some capital shots among them.&nbsp; Thence, on the
same day, we waded through the sand to Tegel, to visit the
residence and private grounds of Baron Humboldt; and from a mound
in his garden beheld the beautifully picturesque view of Lake
Tegel, and the distant towers of Spandau.&nbsp; I have been
present on the Sunday at a review of the Royal Guard in their
striking uniform of black and dazzling white.</p>
<p>Once, we made a river voyage in a huge tub of a boat along the
weedy banks of the Spree, under the command of a female
captain&mdash;a jolly matron, weighing I am afraid to guess how
many stone.&nbsp; I am told it was a very plebeian piece of
business, but we were very happy notwithstanding.&nbsp; We had a
Tafel-lieder party on board, with a due proportion of guitars,
and they played and sang all the way to Treptow and back
again.&nbsp; Once arrived at our destination, we sat upon the
grass, and watched the merry groups around, or sauntered along
the margin of the stream, sipping occasionally very
inconsiderable quantities of feeble cordials; and when the
evening <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>drew near, we re-embarked, and,
under the safe conduct of our female commodore&mdash;who was
skilled in the difficult navigation of the shallow
river&mdash;returned soberly home.&nbsp; The environs of Berlin
are of no great beauty, the city being built on a sandy plain,
with the single eminence of the Kreutzberg, from which it can be
viewed with advantage; but in and about the city there are
beautiful gardens, private and of royal foundation, and these are
invariably open to the public.&nbsp; One happy Sunday afternoon
we spent in Charlottenburg, the pleasure-palace of the king; and
one other in the noble botanical gardens in the city; while on a
fine day the avenue of lime trees, Unter-den-Linden, in its crowd
of promenaders, and social groups at the refreshment tables,
presented an animated, and, to my mind, a recreative and
humanising spectacle.&nbsp; Music was everywhere; and in the
theatres, in the display of pyrotechnic eccentricities, or
perhaps in ballooning&mdash;but that was English&mdash;the
evening was variously spent.&nbsp; There may be dance-houses and
other abominations in Berlin, as in Hamburg, but I never heard of
them, and if they existed, more was the pity.&nbsp; For my own
part, I was happy in enjoying the moderate pleasures of life in
company with the majority of my fellow-workmen, who, I must again
say, and insist upon, were not at work, but at rest, on the
Sunday.&nbsp; It is true that here, as elsewhere, tailors and
boot-makers (master-men) were content to take measures, and
receive orders from the workmen, for very little other
opportunity presented itself for such necessary service.</p>
<p>A few hours&rsquo; whirl on the railway on a Sunday saw us in
Leipsic.&nbsp; This was at the Easter festival; and we stayed two
months in this Saxon market of the world, embracing in their
course the most important of the three great markets in the
year.&nbsp; If ever there was a fair opportunity of judging the
question of Sunday labour and Sunday rest, it was in Leipsic, at
this period.&nbsp; If Sunday work be a necessary consequence of
Sunday recreation&mdash;an absurd paradox, surely&mdash;it would
have been exhibited in a commercial town, at a period when all
the elements of frivolity, as gathered together at a fair; and
all the wants of commerce compressed into a few brief weeks, were
brought into co-existence.&nbsp; Yet in no town in Germany did I
witness so complete a cessation from labour on the Sunday.&nbsp;
There was no question of working.&nbsp; Early in the morning
there was, it is true, a domestic market in the great square,
highly interesting to a stranger from the number <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of
curious costumes collected together; the ringletted Polish Jew,
old Germans from Altenburg, seeming masqueraders from the mining
districts of the Erzgeberge, and country folks from every
neighbouring village, who flocked to Leipsic with their wares and
edibles.&nbsp; But all this was at an end long before the church
service commenced.&nbsp; I have been in the Nicolai-Kirche
(remarkable for its lofty roof, upheld by columns in the form of
palm trees), and the congregation thronged the whole
edifice.&nbsp; And at a smaller church, I was completely wedged
in by the standing crowd of unmistakable working people, whose
congregational singing was particularly effective.&nbsp; The
German Protestant church service is not so long as our own.&nbsp;
There are only a few pews in the body of the building; and the
major part of the audience stand during the service.&nbsp; I was
not so well pleased with one sermon I heard in the English
church, for it happened to be the effort of a German preacher; a
student in our tongue, whose discourse was indeed intrinsically
good, and would have been solemn, if the pauses and emphases had
only been in the right places.</p>
<p>I never worked on Sunday in Leipsic, nor was I acquainted with
any one who did.&nbsp; The warehouses were strictly closed; and a
few booths, with trifling gewgaws, were alone to be seen.&nbsp;
The city was at rest.&nbsp; Leipsic has but one theatre, and to
this the prices of admission are doubled in fair-time, which
placed it out of our reach.&nbsp; Thus we were forced to be
content with humbler sources of amusement, and to find
recreation, which we readily did, in the beautiful promenades
round the city, laid out by Dr. M&uuml;ller; in country rambles
to Breitenfeld, and other old battle-fields; in tracing the
winding paths of a thin wood, near the town, wonderful to us from
the flakes of wool (baumwolle) which whitened the ground.&nbsp;
Or again, among the bands of music and happy crowds which dotted
the Rosenthal&mdash;a title, by the bye, more fanciful than just,
seeing that the vale in question is only a grassy undulating
plain.&nbsp; Here we sometimes met the &ldquo;Herr,&rdquo; with
wife on arm, and exchanged due salutations.</p>
<p>The fair, such as we understand by the name, commenced in the
afternoon, and was a scene of much noise and some drollery.&nbsp;
The whole town teemed with itinerant musicians, whose violent
strains would sometimes burst from the very ground under your
feet, as it appeared, issuing as they did from the open mouths of
beer and wine-cellars.&nbsp; Quiet coffee-houses there were, in
which grave citizens smoked and read; and admirable concerts in
saloons, and in the <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>open air.&nbsp; To one of these
latter I was seduced by the mendacious announcement of a certain
Wagner of Berlin, that a whole troop of real Moors would perform
fantastic tricks before high heaven; and on paying the price of
admission, I had to run the gauntlet through a score of
black-headed Teutons, who salaamed and grinned as they ushered me
into the blank space beyond, containing nothing more interesting
than a few tables and chairs, a dumb brass band, and a swarm of
hungry waiters.&nbsp; I saw no dance-houses, such as there were
in Hamburg; and by nine o&rsquo;clock the festivities of the day
were at an end.&nbsp; The Easter fair lasted some five or six
weeks, and at its termination its merriment disappeared.&nbsp;
The wandering minstrels wailed their last notes as they departed,
and the quiet city was left to its students and the pigeons.</p>
<p>So much for my experiences of Protestant Germany as regards
Sunday occupation.&nbsp; I have, however, said nothing of museums
or picture galleries.&nbsp; I should be sorry to misrepresent the
kindred commercial cities of Hamburg and Leipsic; but I think
they may shake hands on this question, seeing that, at the period
of my visit, they possessed neither the one nor the other.&nbsp;
I do not say that there were no stored-up curiosities, dignified
with the title of museums.&nbsp; But, as far as the public
instruction was concerned, they were nearly useless, being little
known and less visited, and certainly not accessible on the
Sunday.&nbsp; Schwerin, in Mecklenburg, possesses a noble ducal
museum of arts and sciences, but this also was closed on the
weekly holiday; and in Berlin, where the museum, par excellence,
may vie with any in Europe, and which city is otherwise rich in
natural and art collections, the doors of all such places were,
on the Sunday, strictly closed against the people.&nbsp; Of the
good taste which authorises the display of stage scenery and
decorations (and that not of the best), and yet forbids the
inspection of the masterpieces of painting; of the judgment which
patronises beer and tobacco, yet virtually condemns as unholy the
sight of the best evidences of nature&rsquo;s grandeur, and the
beautiful results of human efforts in art, it is not necessary to
treat here.</p>

<p>Still on tramp toward the south, we came to Dresden, and there
rested five days; but as they were week-days their experiences
gave us no insight into the Sunday usages of the place, and I
only allude to them because it would seem unbecoming to pass the
capital of Saxony without a word; and because I feel morally
convinced that of all the art-wonders collected in the Zwinger,
Das Gr&uuml;ne Gew&ouml;lbe, and in the picture gallery, all of
which we visited, not any of them are visible to the public on
Sunday. <a name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a>&nbsp; On a sultry day in August we
struggled, dusty and athirst, into Vienna.&nbsp; It is said that
the first impressions of a traveller are the most faithful, and I
therefore transcribe from a diary of that time some of my
recollections of the first Sunday spent in the capital of
Austria.&nbsp; It is not flattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday (Sunday), we rambled through a part of the
city known as Lerchenfeld, in the suburb of St. Joseph, where the
low life of Vienna is exhibited.&nbsp; It was a kind of
fair.&nbsp; The way was lined with petty booths and stalls,
furnished with fruit, pipes, and common pastry.&nbsp; Here were
sold live rabbits and birds; there, paper clock-faces,
engravings, songs, and figures of saints.&nbsp; In one part was a
succession of places of public resort, like our tea-gardens in
appearance, but devoted to the sale of other beverages; tea being
here almost unknown, except as a medicine.&nbsp; From each of
them there streamed the mingled sounds of obstreperous music and
human voices, while in several there appeared to be a sort of
conjuring exhibition in course of performance.&nbsp; Further on,
there came from the opposite side of the way the screaming of a
flageolet, heard far above its accompaniment of a violin and a
couple of horns, to all of which the shuffling and scraping of
many feet formed a sort of dull bass, as the dancers whirled
round in their interminable waltz.&nbsp; Looking into the window
of the building thus outrageously conspicuous, we saw a motley
crowd of persons of both sexes, and in such a variety of costumes
as scarcely any other city but Vienna could furnish; some of <!--
page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>them careering round in the excitement of the dance;
others impatiently awaiting their turn, or quizzing the dancers;
while a third party sat gravely at the side-tables, smoking their
pipes, playing at cards, and sipping their wine and beer.&nbsp;
Passing onward, we came upon a diminutive merryman, screaming
from the platform of his mountebank theatre, the nature of the
entertainment and the lowness of the price of
admission&mdash;&lsquo;Only four kreutzers for the first
place!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing our course, we were attracted into a
side-street by a crowd, among whom stood conspicuous a brass
musical band, and an old man in a semi-religious costume of black
and white, bearing a large wooden crucifix in his hand.&nbsp; In
anticipation of some religious ceremony, we waited awhile to
watch its development.&nbsp; It was a funeral, and the whole
procession soon formed itself in the following order:&mdash;First
came the large crucifix, then a boy bearing a banner on which was
painted the figure of the Virgin; then came six other boys,
followed by the same number of girls, all neatly and cleanly
dressed; and then the coffin, hung with scarlet drapery, adorned
with flowers, and having a small silver crucifix at its
head.&nbsp; We were told it was the funeral of a girl of
thirteen.&nbsp; Close upon the coffin came the minister, or
priest, clad in a black, loosish gown, and wearing a curiously
crown-shaped cap, also black.&nbsp; Every head was uncovered as
he and the coffin passed.&nbsp; Then came, as we imagined, the
real mourners of the dead, followed by six exceedingly old women,
mourners by profession, and immediately behind them the brass
band which had first attracted our attention.&nbsp; The latter,
as soon as the procession was fairly in motion, burst forth into
a noisy, and by no means melancholy strain, and continued to play
for some time; they suddenly ceased, and there was heard from
some one at the head of the procession a Latin prayer, which was
immediately echoed by the old women in the rear, in the same
drowsy, monotonous tone in which the church responses are usually
made.&nbsp; The scene was altogether curious and striking; the
progress of the procession was everywhere marked by uncovered
heads and signs of sympathy and respect; but in spite of its
attempted solemnity, there was a holiday appearance about it
which jarred sadly with its real character of grief and
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have given this description a front place because it is the
worst thing I can say of Vienna, and in no other part of the city
did I ever see its like.&nbsp; During a stay of twelve months, I
lost no opportunity of enjoying all that the Viennese enjoyed, or
of witnessing whatever <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>was part of
the national customs in festival, holiday, or religious
ceremonial.&nbsp; In addition to the Sundays, which were all, to
a certain extent, days of rejoicing&mdash;there were nine
distinct festivals in the year enjoined by the church, and on
which, if they fell on week-days, the working people rested from
their labours.&nbsp; Of course each of these days had its special
religious reference and obligations, and these were in general
faithfully observed; but, apart from this, they were essentially
holidays, and, as no deduction of wages was made by the employers
on their account, they did not fall as a burden upon the working
classes.&nbsp; These days were: New Year&rsquo;s Day, the
Annunciation, Good Friday, Easter and Whit Sunday, Corpus Christi
Day, All Saints&rsquo; Day, the Birth of the Virgin, Christmas
Day, and the festival of St. Leopold, the patron saint of
Vienna.&nbsp; On the strictly church festivals, with the
exception of All Saints&rsquo; Day, theatrical performances, and
public amusements generally, were interdicted, but rest and quiet
recreation, in addition to the religious observances, were their
great characteristics.&nbsp; Easter and Whit Monday were among
the Volks Feste (people&rsquo;s feasts), as well as one known as
that of the Brigittenau, from the place in which it is held; and
another on the first of May, when the la&uuml;fer (running
footmen) have their races in the Prater, and the emperor permits
himself to be mobbed&mdash;at least the Emperor Francis
did&mdash;as he strolls for a half-hour or so among his people in
their own park.&nbsp; Then the Bohemians have a special religious
festival, when one is astonished to see, in out-of-the-way niches
and corners, a perhaps hitherto-unobserved figure of an
amiable-looking priest, with a star on his forehead, now hung
about and conspicuous with wreaths and festoons of flowers, and
bright with the glittering of tiny lamps.&nbsp; This is the Holy
St. John of Nepomuk.&nbsp; I have, however, nothing to do with
the religious ceremonies of the Catholic Church.&nbsp; It is
sufficient for my purpose to know that I watched the solemn and
splendid procession of mingled royalty, priest, and people, on
Corpus Christi Day, from the open door of a coffee and wine-house
in the Kohl-market; and that, at the Easter festival, after
ascending and descending the Mount Calvary, near Vienna, or
rather having been borne up and down its semicircular flight of
steps, and past the modelled groups of painted figures to
represent the life of Christ, from the birth to the crowning act
of the crucifixion on the summit, I then sauntered away with my
landlord (a cabinet-maker) and his family to Weinhaus, to drink
of the new wine called heueriger.&nbsp; <!-- page 176--><a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>It is
enough that, on All Saints&rsquo; Day, after wandering awhile
about a swampy churchyard in the suburb of Maria Hilf, to see the
melancholy spot of light which glimmered at each grave-head, I
went to the Burg Theatre, and witnessed Shakespeare&rsquo;s play
of &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo; (and the best actor in Vienna played
the Fool); and further, that I spent the evening of Christmas Day
in Daum&rsquo;s coffee-house in reading <i>Galignani&rsquo;s
Messenger</i>, in order to bring myself, in imagination at least,
as near home as possible.</p>
<p>The jewellers in Vienna are not such elderly apprentices as
they are in Hamburg, Leipsic, and the majority of small towns in
Germany.&nbsp; They dine at gast ha&uuml;se, and sleep in the
independence of a separate lodging.&nbsp; They have, therefore,
more liberty; but there are many trades in Vienna among whom the
old usages still exist, by which they become a kind of vassals,
living and sleeping under the patriarchal roof.&nbsp; All worked
twelve hours a-day alike, from six till seven, including one hour
for dinner.&nbsp; Various licences were, however, allowed;
quarter-of-day or half-hour deductions were scarcely known; and I
have myself spent the morning at a public execution, without
suffering any loss in wages.&nbsp; This brings me to the Sunday
work; and I say, unhesitatingly that, as a system, it does not
exist.&nbsp; I never worked on the Sunday myself during my whole
twelve months&rsquo; stay.&nbsp; I do not know that there was any
law against it; but rest was felt to be a necessity after a week
of seventy-two hours&rsquo; labour.&nbsp; It is not unusual, both
in Germany and France, to engage new hands on the Sunday morning,
because it is a leisure time, convenient to both master and
workman; and I have sought for work at this time, and found the
Herr in a silk dressing-gown, and white satin slippers with pink
bows.&nbsp; I recollect visiting a working cabinet-maker&rsquo;s
on one Sunday morning, whose men slept on the premises, and found
the workshop a perfect model of cleanliness and order: every tool
in its place, and the whole swept and polished up; and was once
invited, under the impression that, as an Englishman, I ought to
know something of newspaper presses, to inspect those of the
Imperial Printing Office, with the last number of the Wiener
Zeitung in type; and this was on a Sunday morning&mdash;a time
especially chosen on account of the absence of the workmen.&nbsp;
My landlord, a master-man, would sometimes work in the Sunday
morning when hard pressed; but, if he did, he took his revenge in
the week.</p>
<p>As we did not work, at what did we play?&nbsp; Perhaps there
was a <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>sick comrade to visit in the great
hospital; and we paced the long corridors, and stepped lightly
through the lofty wards to his bedside.&nbsp; Or, if he were
convalescent, we sought him out, among many others, in the open
square, with its broad grass-plots and young trees, where, in his
grey loose gown, he smoked a morning pipe.&nbsp; Or we went to
church, I, with others, to the Evangelical Chapel near the
Augustine Platz.&nbsp; There, among a closely-pressed throng, we
heard admirable discourses (and not too long, the whole service
being concluded in an hour), and heard much beautiful music; but,
to my mind, there were too many tawdry ornaments in this place of
worship&mdash;too many lamps about the altar; and the altar-piece
itself&mdash;a gigantic figure of the Saviour on the Cross, said
to be by Albert D&uuml;rer&mdash;seemed to be out of place.</p>
<p>It was lawful in Vienna to bathe on Sunday; and this we did,
with great delight, in the public baths upon the Danube.&nbsp; Or
we strolled about the Glacis; attended the miniature review in
the Hof-Burg; wandered out as far as Am-Spitz, by the long wooden
bridge over the broad and melancholy river; or, what was better,
sauntered in some one of the beautiful gardens of the Austrian
nobility,&mdash;those of Schwargenberg, Lichtenstein, or in the
Belvidere&mdash;thrown open to the public, not only on Sunday,
but on every day in the week.</p>
<p>As the day waned, music burst forth in many strains at
once.&nbsp; There was a knot of artisans in our back room, who
were learning the entire &ldquo;Czar and Zimmerman,&rdquo; and
who were very vigorous about this hour.&nbsp; At seven, the
theatres opened their doors, with something of our own rush and
press, although there was a guard-house, and a whole company of
grenadiers in the ante-room; but, once in the interior, all was
order and decorum.&nbsp; There was, of course, a difference in
tone and character between the city and the suburban theatres,
inasmuch as the ices and coffee of the court playhouses found
their parallel in the beer and hot sausages of the Joseph Stadt
and An-der-Wieden; but the performances of all rarely occupied
more than two, and never exceeded three hours; and there was an
amount of quiet and propriety manifested during the
entertainment, which said something for the authorities, but more
for the people.</p>
<p>As the night deepened, the ball-rooms and dancing-booths of
Vienna,&mdash;the Sperl&rsquo;s, Das Tanz Salon beim Schaf, and
so downward to the dens of Lerchenfeld&mdash;grew furious in
music, and hysterical in waltz.&nbsp; It was something
fearful.&nbsp; It made your eyes twinkle, <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>and your
head dizzy, to see that eternal whirling of so many human
teetotums.&nbsp; They seemed to see nothing, to feel nothing, to
know nothing; there was no animation in their looks; no
speculation in their eyes; nothing but a dead stare, as if the
dancers were under a spell, only to be released when the music
was at an end.&nbsp; Generally speaking, I think the ball-rooms
of continental cities are the curses and abominations of the
Sunday.&nbsp; My landlord, who was no moralist, but played faro,
draughts, and billiards on the Sunday evening, would not hear of
his daughter attending a public ballroom.&nbsp; There is a
curious anomaly in connection with places of public entertainment
which strikes a stranger at once, and which is equally true of
Berlin as of Vienna; it is this: that, while private houses are
closed at nine and ten o&rsquo;clock, according to the season of
the year, coffee-houses, taverns, dancing and concert-rooms, are
open till midnight.&nbsp; Up to the former hours you may gain
admission to your own house by feeing the porter to the extent of
twopence; but, later than this, it is dangerous to try the
experiment.</p>
<p>To return to out-of-door amusements.&nbsp; A visit to
Sch&oelig;nbrun was business for a whole afternoon; for we must
perforce each time unravel the windings to the pure spring in the
maze, with vague and mysterious ideas of some time or other
falling upon the grave of the Duc de Reichstadt, there secretly
buried, according to popular tradition.&nbsp; On rare occasions
we spent the whole of Sunday in some more distant palatial
domain, or suburban retreat.&nbsp; In Klosterneuburgh, with its
good wine: in the Br&uuml;hl, with its rugged steeps, its
military memorials, and ruined castles; at the village of
Bertholdsdorf, with its Turkish traditions; among the viny slopes
of the Leopoldiberg, or the more distant and wilder tract of
mingled rock and forest which encircle the Vale of Helen.&nbsp;
Above all, there was Laxenberg,&mdash;an imperial pleasure-palace
and garden, and a whole fairy-land in itself, peopled by the
spirits of ancient knights and courtly dames.&nbsp; Some one of
the Hapsburgs had built, many years ago, a knightly castle on a
lake, and in it were stored dim suits of armour of Maximilian; a
cabinet of Wallenstein; grim portraits of kings and warriors;
swords, halbards, jewelled daggers, and antique curiosities
innumerable; only rather prosaically completed by the exhibition
of the every-day suit of the last Emperor of Austria, which,
however affecting a spectacle for a simple-hearted
Viennese&mdash;and they are mere babies in matters of
royalty&mdash;irresistibly reminded <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>one of
Holywell Street, London, and cast-off regimentals.&nbsp;
Laxenberg is distant less than a shilling ride, and about two
hours&rsquo; walk from Vienna; and, like our Hampton Court
Palace, is thrown unreservedly open to the public.&nbsp; There
were no end to its wonders: fishing-grounds, and boats upon the
lake; waterfalls, and rustic bridges were there; and one little
elegant pavilion, perched on the water, dedicated to the beauties
of Windsor, illustrating its scenery in transparent
porcelain.&nbsp; There was a list for knightly riders; a dais for
the Queen of Beauty; and places for belted nobles, saintly
abbots, and Wambas in motley; an Ashby-de-la-Zouch in miniature,
which a little imagination could people.&nbsp; Then, for the
plebeians, there were leaping-bars and turning-posts,
skittle-alleys, and the quintain; and, for all alike, clusters of
noble trees, broad grassy meads, and flowers unnumbered.&nbsp;
There was even a farm-house, homely and substantial, with a dairy
and poultry-yard, sheep in the paddocks, and cattle in the
stalls.</p>
<p>We started from Vienna on a Sunday morning on board the
steamboat Karl for Linz; and trudging thence on foot came on the
following Saturday night into Salzburg, the queen of the
Salzack.&nbsp; We rested here one happy Sunday: not so much in
the town, which had its abundant curiosities, as in the pleasure
gardens of the old Archbishops of Salzburg, at an easy stroll
from it.&nbsp; This garden is pleasant enough in itself, but
there are besides a number of water eccentricities in it such as
I should think were in their peculiar fashion unequalled.&nbsp;
Here blooms a cluster of beautiful flowers, covered as it were by
a glass shade, but which turns out to be only water.&nbsp; There
a miniature palace is in course of erection, with crowds of
workmen in its different storeys, each man at his avocation with
hammer and chisel, pulley and wheel, and the grave architect
himself directing their labour.&nbsp; All this is set in motion
by water, and is not a mere doll&rsquo;s house, but a symmetrical
model.&nbsp; Then we enter a subterranean grotto, with a roof of
pendant stalactites, where the pleasant sound of falling waters
and the melodious piping of birds fill all the air.&nbsp; There
is a sly drollery too in some of the water performances, invented
years ago by the grave Archbishops of Salzburg; for suddenly the
stalactites are set dripping like a modern shower bath: and the
gigantic stags at its entrance spout water from the very tips of
their horns.&nbsp; The garden is not a Versailles, for there is
nothing grand in any of its hydraulic <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>arrangements; but in the beauty with which are clothed
such trifles, the artistic spirit which has suggested its
objects, and the humour which spirts up tiny jets of water by
seats where lovers sit, and in unsuspected places where the
public congregate, even in the middle of a walk, it is a
wonderful and delightful exhibition.&nbsp; This garden was
thronged by the holiday folks of Salzburg.&nbsp; There was an
official to explain the curious display, and nothing but innocent
gaiety was to be seen.</p>
<p>The Sunday we spent in Munich was passed in the Kirche Unserer
Lieben Frauen, with its self-supporting roof; in the English
Garden; and at a lovely spot on a hill-side, in the environs of
the city.&nbsp; During the week we were escorted by a friend to a
sort of tea-gardens of some notoriety, but found it silent and
deserted.&nbsp; Our friend apologised for its dulness, but
exclaimed, in part explanation, &ldquo;You should see it on
Sunday!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was evident that Sunday was a day of rest
and enjoyment, and not a working day in Munich.&nbsp; My own
impression of the Munichers was, that they drank too much beer
every day in the week.</p>
<p>Still tramping towards France, we passed one Sunday in
Heidelberg, among all its romantic wonders; but as everybody
knows, or ought to know, all about Heidelberg, I will not allow
my enthusiasm to lead me into a description which would not be
novel, and might probably be tedious.&nbsp; This was the last
Sunday we spent on German ground.&nbsp; So far as Germany is
concerned, you may look upon everything but museums, picture
galleries, and the like, on Sunday; you may, as Luther says you
ought, &ldquo;dance on it, ride on it, play on it,&mdash;do
anything&rdquo;&mdash;but see that which is most likely to
instruct you.&nbsp; You may visit tawdry shows, and inspect badly
painted scenery; you may let off fireworks; gamble to your ruin;
smoke the eyes out of your head, and dance the head off your
shoulders; but you shall not, with few exceptions, look upon
works of art, or the results of science in museums and picture
galleries.&nbsp; Let it be said, however, that the general
opportunities for acquiring correct and elevated taste are, on
the whole, greater in Germany than in England; and that in many
cities there is a profusion of exterior ornament, more especially
in Munich, in the shape of the fresco paintings of the Palace
Garden, on Isar Thor, and in the Basilica and churches generally,
so that the eye is better educated in artistic combinations; and
the same necessity does not exist for special art instruction
with them as <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>with us.&nbsp; Then, let us never
forget that their public and other gardens are as free to them as
the air they breathe, and that music is almost as universal.</p>
<p>The remembrances I have of Paris Sundays decidedly possess a
character of rest and recreation; of waking in the morning to a
grateful sense of repose; of clean shirts and trimmed beards; and
of delicious breakfasts at our Caf&eacute; aux Quatres Mendiants,
of coffee and white bread, instead of the bouillon and confiture
of the atelier.&nbsp; Did we not work, then?&nbsp; Assuredly we
did sometimes, when hard pressed; but the recollection of those
few occasions is drowned in that of a flood of happy, tranquil
Sundays.&nbsp; When we did work it was from eight till twelve,
which made half a day, and this was the rate at which all
overtime was reckoned.&nbsp; One hard taskmaster I remember, who,
instead of paying us our dues, as is the custom on Saturday
night, at the end of quinze jours, cajoled us to come and work
under the promise of their payment on the Sunday morning.&nbsp;
He failed us like a rogue; and we drudged on for another
quinzaine, Sunday mornings included, in hopeful anticipation of
the receipt of our wages.&nbsp; When we found that he slunk out
of the way, without paying us a sou, we rebelled, sang the
Marseillaise, demanded our wages, and never worked another
Sunday.</p>
<p>I am lost in my endeavours to define the mingled recollections
of Sunday tranquillity, enjoyment, and frivolity during a stay of
eighteen months in Paris.&nbsp; My thoughts run from the
Madelaine to Minu-montant; from Versailles to the Funambule; from
Diogenes&rsquo; lantern at St. Cloud to the blind man&rsquo;s
concert in the Palais Royal.&nbsp; Sometimes I wander over the
plains of Auteuil and Passy; then suddenly find myself examining
a paper-making machine in the Museum of Arts and Trades.&nbsp; Or
I look over the vine fields from the heights of Montmorency at
one moment, and the next am pacing the long galleries of the
Louvre, or the classic chambers of the Palais des Beaux
Arts.&nbsp; I have passed a Whitsunday morning at Versailles
among the paintings; the afternoon at S&egrave;vres among glass
and porcelain; have won a game at dominoes after dinner in Paris;
and have heard the last polka at the Salle Vivienne in the
evening.&nbsp; Paris is a city of extremes; the young
Th&eacute;ophile who works by my side, and is an ingenious fellow
and a clever workman, you will meet next Sunday in the Louvre
discoursing energetically on the comparative merits of the French
and Italian schools of painting; yet this same Th&eacute;ophile
shall be the Titi of the gallery of <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>the Porte
St. Martin in the evening, who yells slang at his friend on the
opposite side; and the Pierrot or D&eacute;bardeur of the next
opera masquerade.</p>
<p>With the vivid impressions of many Sundays abroad upon my
mind, I have been wondering whether, after all, the practices of
the continental Sunday have anything to do with the opening of a
museum or picture-gallery in London; and, after profound study,
in the laborious course of which I have several times fallen
asleep, I have come to the deliberate conclusion that there is no
connection between the two things.&nbsp; In the first case, as
regards Germany, seeing that they there almost sedulously close
all that relates to art or science, and give full licence only to
beer and tobacco, to music and dancing on the Sunday&mdash;where
is the parallel?&nbsp; In the second, as regards France or Paris,
although it must be admitted that there is unfortunately no
comparison between the Louvre and the National Gallery, it can at
least be claimed that there is no resemblance between the British
Museum and the Bal des Chiens in the Rue St. Honor&eacute;.&nbsp;
I take it that to preserve the English Sunday as a day of greater
rest than French or German Sundays ever were, and to add to it
such rational and instructive recreation, as a Museum or a
Picture-Gallery, or a place of innocent recreation could supply,
might be a good thing in the eyes of religious men; and I have
not yet heard of any society or association in any part of the
United Kingdom, which proposes to open a Sunday evening ball at
the Pig and Tinderbox, or to grant licences to the theatrical
performances at the Penny Gaff in the New Cut.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
